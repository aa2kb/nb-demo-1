*   To aim to ensure consistency and professionalism in everyday procurement activities.

3,What is the principle behind transparency in procurement?,"The principle behind transparency in procurement in Abu Dhabi is multifaceted, centered on ensuring broad access to procurement information, promoting fairness for all suppliers, and maintaining compliance with applicable legislation.

This principle is enforced through several key requirements:

*   **General Openness:** Ensuring an adequate degree of openness by allowing **free access to procurement information**.
*   **Fair Treatment:** Promoting **fair treatment of Suppliers** throughout the process.
*   **Compliance:** Ensuring **compliance with applicable legislations**.

Procedurally, transparency mandates specific actions, particularly concerning supplier communication:

*   Responses provided by the 'Project Owner' to Suppliers' questions or requests **are made available to all participating Suppliers**.
*   The Sourcing Specialist/Lead must actively **ensure that the identity of competing Suppliers is kept confidential** when sharing these responses.

These steps ensure that all potential bidders operate from the same set of information while maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the competitive process.

4,What must a purchase order include according to the standards?,"According to Abu Dhabi government procurement standards and manuals, a Purchase Order (PO) must include several key details to accurately define the transaction between the purchasing entity and the supplier.

The essential components that a Purchase Order must include are:

*   **Descriptions** of the goods or services being ordered.
*   **Quantities** of the items ordered.
*   **Agreed Prices** for the items.
*   Applicable **Discounts**.
*   The **Delivery Schedule** or **Shipment/Delivery Dates**.
*   **Payment Terms**.
*   **Supplier details**.

Furthermore, specific standards mandate the inclusion of:

*   A reference to the **Contract or the Price List Agreement** under which the order is placed.
*   Assignment of every line item to one of the categories following the **Category Hierarchy**.

These requirements ensure clarity, compliance, and accurate tracking of procurement activities.

(Citation: Abu Dhabi Procurement Standards; Procurement Manual (Ariba Aligned); Procurement Manual (Business Process))",It must include Delivery Terms and Payment Terms.,Purchase Orders must clearly include Delivery Terms and Payment Terms as part of the contract agreement.,0.07692307692307693,0.62,1.0
5,How do Delivery Terms and Payment Terms relate to a Purchase Order?,"Delivery Terms and Payment Terms are both critical elements that define the obligations within a transaction initiated by a Purchase Order (PO) in Abu Dhabi Government procurement.

Here is how they relate:

### Payment Terms

*   **Inclusion in PO:** **Payment Terms** are consistently identified as a key detail required to be included directly within the Purchase Order document itself.
*   **Definition:** They specify the **period and modality of payment** that will be made to the Supplier for the goods or services provided.
*   **Mandate:** Procurement departments must adhere to these defined terms when creating the order, and payments must subsequently be processed according to the terms specified in the order or contract.

### Delivery Terms

*   **Inclusion Context:** **Delivery Terms** are defined as specifying the **responsibilities of Suppliers for the delivery of goods and services**.
*   **Documentation:** While the PO typically includes shipment/delivery dates, the comprehensive Delivery Terms are explicitly stated to be **part of the overall contract documentation** prepared by the Procurement function, which the PO supports and executes.

In summary, the **Purchase Order** serves as the official document that binds the parties, containing the agreed-upon **Payment Terms** and referencing the contractual **Delivery Terms** to manage both the financial settlement and the logistics of the transaction.

14,How are Common Categories classified?,"Thank you for your inquiry regarding the classification of categories within Abu Dhabi Government frameworks.

Based on the **Abu Dhabi Procurement Standards**, classification and structure are primarily addressed through **Category Strategy** and **Category Hierarchy**.

Here is how categories are managed:

*   **Category Hierarchy:** This structure is referenced for the purpose of planning, execution, reporting, and assigning line items within a Purchase Order.

*   **Category Segmentation:** Procurement Practitioners are required to prepare a category segmentation as part of the overall category strategy. This segmentation must consider the following key elements:
    *   Criticality of the category for the relevant government entity.
    *   Ease of supply of goods, services, and projects, including the possibility of Supplier substitution.
    *   Potential benefits to be realized from the category management strategy.

This approach ensures that categories are classified and managed based on their strategic importance and supply risk.
