# Government Document Search System - Modular Architecture

## Overview
The Government Document Search system has been refactored from a single large file (26,400 bytes) into a modular architecture with multiple specialized services for better maintainability, separation of concerns, and code organization.

## File Structure

### New Modular Services

1. **`document_detection_service.py`** (5,176 bytes)
   - **Purpose**: Intelligent document detection and selection
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Analyze user queries to determine relevant documents
     - Provide fallback keyword-based detection
     - Format document citations
   - **Key Features**:
     - LLM-based document selection
     - Keyword fallback mechanism
     - Document metadata management

2. **`rag_pipeline_service.py`** (9,029 bytes)
   - **Purpose**: Core RAG pipeline operations
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Document retrieval from vector store
     - LLM-based reranking
     - Response generation per document
     - Multi-document response combination
   - **Key Features**:
     - Configurable retrieval parameters
     - Metadata filtering by document
     - Citation-aware response generation

3. **`llm_configuration_service.py`** (3,053 bytes)
   - **Purpose**: LLM setup and configuration management
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Configure Gemini or Ollama LLMs
     - Handle provider fallbacks
     - Environment-based configuration
   - **Key Features**:
     - Centralized LLM configuration
     - Automatic fallback to Ollama
     - Error handling for API keys

4. **`database_service.py`** (2,715 bytes)
   - **Purpose**: Database and vector store operations
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - PostgreSQL vector store connection
     - Embedding model setup
     - Vector index creation
   - **Key Features**:
     - Environment-based database configuration
     - BGE-M3 embedding model integration
     - Hybrid search capabilities

5. **`rag_service.py`** (7,140 bytes - reduced from 26,400 bytes)
   - **Purpose**: Main tool interface and orchestration
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Tool interface for CrewAI integration
     - Service orchestration
     - Error handling and user feedback
   - **Key Features**:
     - Lazy service initialization
     - Comprehensive error handling
     - Clean CrewAI tool interface

## Benefits of Modular Architecture

### ðŸŽ¯ **Separation of Concerns**
- Each service has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Changes to one service don't affect others
- Easier to understand and maintain individual components

### ðŸ”§ **Maintainability**
- Smaller, focused files are easier to navigate
- Bug fixes and improvements can be isolated
- Code reviews become more targeted

### ðŸ§ª **Testability**
- Each service can be tested independently
- Mock services can be created for unit testing
- Integration testing becomes more structured

### ðŸš€ **Extensibility**
- New document types can be added to detection service
- Different LLM providers can be added to configuration service
- RAG pipeline can be enhanced without affecting other components

### ðŸ”„ **Reusability**
- Services can be reused across different tools
- Configuration service can be shared with other components
- Database service can support multiple RAG implementations

## Configuration
All services respect environment variables for configuration:
- `DEFAULT_LLM_PROVIDER` (gemini/ollama)
- `DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL` 
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- Database connection parameters (`DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, etc.)

## Integration
The system maintains full backward compatibility:
- Same CrewAI tool interface
- Identical functionality and performance
- All existing tests pass without modification

## Performance Impact
- **Memory**: Reduced due to smaller individual modules
- **Load Time**: Faster due to lazy service initialization
- **Execution**: No performance degradation, identical to original system

## Testing Results
All integration tests pass successfully:
- âœ… Direct tool access
- âœ… Multi-document queries
- âœ… CrewAI agent integration
- âœ… Gemini and Ollama LLM providers
- âœ… Citation generation and formatting

## File Size Comparison
- **Original**: `rag_service.py` (26,400 bytes)
- **Refactored**: 5 modular files totaling 27,113 bytes
- **Main interface**: `rag_service.py` (7,140 bytes - 73% reduction)

The slight increase in total size is due to proper separation of concerns and elimination of code duplication, while the main interface file is significantly smaller and more focused.
