# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Introduction to Procurement Manual

### 1.1.1 Purpose of the Procurement Manual
The Procurement Manual provides operational procedures to the *Procurement* practitioners. It reinforces the Procurement Standards, the Procurement Charter, and the Procurement Delegation of Authority (PDoA), giving a more detailed explanation of their application.

### 1.1.2 Scope of the Procurement Manual
The Procurement Manual applies to all procurement activities conducted by the government Entities and the Government Procurement Office (GPO). The Executive Council (EC), or a relevant body authorised by the EC, may exclude an Entity from the application of the Procurement Manual. The Procurement Manual covers all relevant procurement processes and serves as the operational framework.

### 1.1.2.(I) List of Exemptions
The Procurement Manual does not apply to:
1) Staff salaries and benefits.
2) Direct employment contracts or the engagement individual experts which cannot be subject to tender.
3) General and administration expenses for non-predefined technical specifications, electricity, water, utilities, accommodation rentals provided to the employees and governed by the housing policies, professional and non-professional bodies' subscriptions, fee paid to organisers of conferences/exhibitions.
4) Agreements among government Entities or with international professional bodies for the purposes of research/collaboration/promotions.
5) Sponsorships and grants.
6) Purchase of artworks, artifacts, and associated ancillary expenses.
7) Copyrights license fees except where there is a contractual obligation to purchase goods, services or projects.
8) Reimbursement of adhoc expenses incurred during travel (below Petty Cash threshold).
9) Mandatory or Regulatory fees (such as court fees, duties and taxes, bank fees etc.)
10) Any other exceptions approved by the Executive Council (EC).

### 1.1.3 Structure of the Manual
The structure of the Procurement Manual is aligned to the Procurement Capability Model (refer to Figure 1.3.1):
1) Level 1 - Procurement capabilities are classified into Strategic, Tactical, Operational, and Support capabilities.

*Figure 1.2.1 Procurement Capability Model*

The Government Procurement Office (GPO) is established to fulfil the following objectives:

1) Acting on behalf of the Entities to consolidate demand for achieving economies of scale. The GPO is authorized to manage and execute sourcing for Common Categories.

2) Providing shared services such as Supplier Registration, Item Master Management, User Master Management, and Training.

3) Maintaining the Procurement Framework ensuring a standardized and efficient way of working of the *Procurement*.

4) Developing and operating the information technology platform for government procurement (eGate).

5) Running market development initiatives and managing partnerships with the private sector in coordination with the relevant authorities.

Entity *Procurement* is responsible for procurement of the Entity-Specific Categories including sourcing, contracting, ordering, and managing *Supplier* performance. The Entity *Procurement* utilizes the shared services provided by the GPO.

DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

The GPO engages stakeholders from the Entities and dedicated *Finance, Legal* or other resources as needed for procuring Common Categories. The Entity *Procurement* engages *End-Users* and dedicated *Finance, Legal* or other resources for procuring Entity-Specific Categories.

## 1.2.1 Category Classification

Classification of a category as a Common Category or an Entity-Specific Category depends on the category spend value and its commonality across Entities. A category that is procured by five or more Entities may be considered as a Common Category.

## 1.2.2 Category Taxonomy

Category taxonomy refers to a hierarchical assignment of goods/services. In line with global best practices, UNSPSC (United Nations Standard Products and Services Code) taxonomy is deployed in "SAP Ariba". It is a four-level taxonomy with each record represented with an eight-digit number and unique name, illustrated below:

*Figure 1.2.3 UNSPSC Categorizations in "SAP Ariba modules"*

The four primary levels of the UNSPSC are Segment, Family, Class, and Commodity. Each level is identified by two digits, that constitute together an overall eight-digit code.

All Abu Dhabi DED activities are mapped to Level 2 UNSPSC categories. **Suppliers** are registered in the Supplier Master Database, maintained by the Department of Government Support (DGS), at Level 2 UNSPSC categories, and line items are created in "SAP Ariba" at Level 3 UNSPSC categories.

## 1.3 Procurement Capability Model

The Procurement Capability Model comprises of four types of procurement capabilities: Strategic, Tactical, Operational, and Support as illustrated below:

## 1.4 Procurement Benefits

This section provides the details regarding:

1) Definition of Baseline Spend and Procurement Benefits
2) General principles that apply to Baseline Spend and Procurement Benefits
3) Methodologies to calculate the Baseline Spend and Procurement Benefits

### 1.4.1 Definitions

i. **Baseline Spend**
   
   Baseline Spend is the foundation of the Procurement Benefits calculation. It is the value of addressable spend against which any benefit is measured. Establishing a baseline is the first step in the Procurement Benefits calculations process.

ii. **Classification of Procurement Benefits**
    
    Procurement Benefits can be classified into Cost Reduction, Cost Avoidance, and Cash Impact. Details of the same are provided below:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Cost Reduction<br><i>'same for less'</i></th>
<th>Cost Avoidance<br><i>'avoiding future cost'</i></th>
<th>Cash Impact</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Definition</td>
<td>• Benefits that directly reduce the cost base compared to the baseline<br>• Costs can be one-offs or recurring/sustainable</td>
<td>• Cost was not included in the original baseline<br>• Action taken now to avoid future incremental costs<br>• Could include initiatives that lead to cost reduction in the future</td>
<td>• One - time impact of increased cash</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Example</td>
<td>• Reduction in cost of software licenses resulting from optimization<br>• A one-time saving such as a rebate or volume reduction in the prior year.</td>
<td>• Consumption reduced because of increase in efficiency or optimization<br>• Price increase as a result of external factors, e.g. an increase in regulatory minimum wage, is offset by a reduced agency fee mark-up</td>
<td>• Cash impact due to outstanding payables with <i>Supplier</i> (increased 'Payment Terms')<br>• Sale or decrease of inventory</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Measurement</td>
<td>• Hard benefits (savings or additional revenue) vs Baseline Spend<br>• Spend reduction year-over-year</td>
<td>• No increase in year-over-year spend particular to the relevant cost avoidance initiative (e.g., demand optimization)<br>• Cost avoidance demonstrated by comparing the variance in volume and price.</td>
<td>• One - time impact demonstrated by estimating benefits.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**Table 1.4.1 Procurement Benefits Classification**

DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

## 1.4.2 General Principles

Following general principles apply to the calculation of Baseline Spend and Procurement Benefits:

i. **Baseline principles**

1) An agreed baseline is required for Procurement Benefits calculations and must be signed-off by the relevant stakeholders from the *End-User*, the *Finance* and the *Procurement*.
2) Baseline could be historic actuals (e.g., prior year spend, budgeted spend, etc.).
3) The baseline must be supported by one or multiple data sets, such as Accounts Payable (AP) data, Purchase Orders (PO) data, Contracts data, etc.
4) An appropriate method to calculate the Baseline Spend should be determined for each type of procurement benefit.

ii. **Procurement Benefits calculation principles**

1) Procurement Benefits can be calculated after acceptance of a final, binding offer from one or more *Supplier(s)* and the acknowledgment of offer conditions (with written confirmation, Letter of Intent, contract amendment, etc.).
2) Benefits implementation costs (one-time investments) are excluded from the benefits calculation.

## 1.4.3 Calculation Methodologies

i. **Baseline Spend**

Baseline Spend is based on two parameters and is calculated as following:

*Baseline Spend = Total Volume * Baseline Unit Price*

Total volume may be known or unknown. However, two methods can be used for calculations to estimate volume, as detailed below:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Method</th>
<th>Situation</th>
<th>Method</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Demand Plan Forecast Volume</td>
<td>Forecast is known</td>
<td>• 100% of forecast volume for the specific spend area</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Historic forecast volume</td>
<td>Forecast is unknown</td>
<td>• 50% of historic volume + (50% of historic volume * category demand growth forecast %)<br>In general, previous year volumes are used as historic volumes; if this data is not available, the period that is used to calculate historic volume should be mentioned.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

*Table 1.4.2 Volume Estimation Methodologies*

Baseline unit price may be estimated using one of the following methodologies:

12
Procurement Manual (SAP Ariba Aligned)


---



دائرة الإسناد الحكومي
DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

1) Historic price baseline
   Historic price baseline is relevant when the goods/services/projects were purchased previously (in last year). Below are the details of various methods to create a historic price baseline:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Price Method</th>
<th>Situation</th>
<th>Method</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Last Price Paid</td>
<td>Used where market is not volatile (applicable for components and traded items like office furniture, etc.).</td>
<td>• Last actual paid price in the Purchase Order (PO), or<br>• Contracted price, if last actual paid price is not available</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Average Price</td>
<td>Used in case of a volatile market (applicable for e.g., 100% index-based commodities)</td>
<td>• Average Price paid over the last year</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Average quoted Market Price</td>
<td>Used in case of a volatile market (Commodities for which transparent and independent index are not available)</td>
<td>• Average Price of historical offers after clarification from the <em>Suppliers</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

*Table 1.4.3 Historic Baseline Price - Calculation Methodologies*

2) Comparable price baseline
   If a certain goods/service/projects has not been purchased previously, historic price baseline cannot be established. In such cases, the baseline price can be estimated using comparable goods/services/projects (identical or similar specifications) where the price is known. (e.g., estimating the baseline price for a car rental service by comparing it with similar services previously purchased by another Entity).

3) New price baseline
   If neither a historic nor a comparable baseline can be established, a new baseline can be developed based on the initial RFI or RFP/RFQ responses provided by the *Suppliers*. The baseline price will be calculated as an average of the approved initial quotes. Any price reductions received through follow-on RFP/ auction/negotiation is considered as benefits.

ii. Procurement Benefits
    As illustrated in Table 1.4.1, Procurement Benefits are classified into three buckets:

    1) Cost Savings
       Following are the various Cost Savings scenarios:

       a. Standard Method (last paid price – new price)
          This method is used when the savings result from the difference between baseline and negotiated price. For example, when *Suppliers* are changed or when similar goods/services are bundled, resulting in a better price per item. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

          *Savings = (baseline price – negotiated price) * volume*

13
Procurement Manual (SAP Ariba Aligned)


---



دائرة الإسناد الحكومي
DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

b. **Free of charges Extra**
   These are the savings realized when contracts negotiated with **Suppliers** include 'extras' that have not been part of the goods/services/projects offering of past purchases. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

   *Savings = Savings from free of charge 'extra' per unit * volume*

c. **Fluctuating market price with market Index**
   This method of calculation is used when the cost savings can be attributed to a changing market index that results in a better future price (with respect to the market price). This method is applicable for commodities (crude oil, metals, agri-commodities, etc.) where prices are linked to indices and change frequently. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

*Savings = Forecasted spend with historical index value – forecasted spend with new index value*

d. **Fluctuating market price without market Index**
   This method of calculation is used when there are no market price references available. There may be no good benchmarks to indicate the savings w.r.t the market. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

   *Savings = (Initial offer – negotiated offer) * expected volume*

e. **Volume Rebate**
   This method of calculation is used when the **Supplier** offers rebates on volume or similar incentives, which have not been included in previous purchases. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

   *Savings = (new rebate per unit – old rebate per unit) * volume*

f. **Re-engineered specification (substitution) / rationalization**
   For some goods/services/projects, the specification can be changed to reduce the price. New specifications examples may include (but not limited to) using black and white printers instead of coloured printers, using standard cars instead of high-end cars for rentals, and using standard event designs instead of specialized events. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

   *Savings = (Cost for original item/service – cost for substitute item/service) * volume*

g. **In-house vs. Outsourcing**
   For some categories, where services are provided in-house, outsourcing of services might be a viable option. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

   *Savings = (In-house cost (i.e. labor cost + material cost + overhead cost) – purchase price) x volume*

14
Procurement Manual (SAP Ariba Aligned)

دائرة الإسناد الحكومي
DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

h. **Lease vs. Buy**
   For some categories lease of goods might be a viable alternative to buying (or vice versa).
   To compare the savings between leasing and buying options for goods, the cost per one
   unit needs to be calculated and compared. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

   *Savings = (Cost of purchasing per unit - leasing cost per unit) * volume*

i. **Reduced Cost of Disposal**
   At the end of their lifetime, some goods (e.g., Laptop) may be recycled. These costs need
   to be considered to determine the actual price of a product. Savings in this scenario are
   calculated as follows:

   *Savings = Historic cost for disposal – new cost for disposal*

2) **Cost Avoidance**
   Following are various Cost Avoidance scenario:

   a. **Demand reduction/yield improvement**
      This method of calculation is used when the volume of a defined goods/service/projects has
      been reduced through active negotiations by *Procurement*, (i.e., demand control). Savings
      in this scenario are calculated as follows:

      *Savings = (Last volume – negotiated new volume) * last price*

   b. **Reduced cost of service**
      This method is used to calculate the cost reductions for service (e.g., reduced maintenance
      cost through introduction of preventive measures). Savings in this scenario are calculated as
      follows:

      *Savings = (Historic service cost – new service cost)*

3) **Cash Impact**
   Following are the various Cash Impact scenarios:

   a. **Inventory reduction**
      This method is used when the involvement of *Procurement* leads to a reduction of
      inventories (e.g., stock) and results in significant cost savings. Savings in this scenario are
      calculated as follows:

      *Savings = (Old Inventory levels – New Inventory levels) x WACC*
      (WACC – Weighted Average Cost of Capital)

b. **Payment term extension**
   This method is used when the involvement of *Procurement* results in a change of 'Payment Terms' and leads to a working capital improvement. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

   *Savings = Working Capital Improvement = Average monthly invoice from supplier (VAT included) * New Payment terms (in days) / 30 * WACC*

   (VAT – Value added tax; WACC – Weighted Average Cost of Capital)

## 2. Procurement Processes Groups

### 2.1 Procurement Strategy

#### 2.1.1 Overview

'Procurement Strategy' is a high-level document that states an Entity's approach to achieving its procurement objectives, executing its activities and key initiatives. The 'Procurement Strategy' is created with mid-to-long term perspective and updated yearly. Key elements of value proposition addressed by the 'Procurement Strategy' include (but not limited to):

<table>
<tr>
<td>Increased Value to the Entity</td>
<td>Improved Efficiency and Effectiveness</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Greater Stakeholders Alignment</td>
<td>Enhanced External Partnerships</td>
</tr>
</table>

*Figure 2.1.1 Value Proposition – Procurement Strategy*

'Procurement Strategy' guides on allocation of resources and budget for strategic initiatives.

The 'Procurement Strategy' aligns procurement activities with the overall Entity strategy and Abu Dhabi Governmental initiatives The *Head of Procurement* is responsible for the creation of the Procurement Strategy. The *Head of Procurement* assigns key members from *Procurement* to create and monitor execution of the 'Procurement Strategy'.

Development of the 'Procurement Strategy' is an offline process. Following are the key steps to develop a 'Procurement Strategy':

#### 2.1.1.(I) Step 1 – Internal and External Analysis

i. <ins>Analyze procurement practice</ins>
   The assigned key members conduct an analysis of the Entity *Procurement* on following aspects to identify procurement optimization initiatives:
   1) People

18
Procurement Manual (SAP Ariba Aligned)


---



دائرة الإسناد الحكومي
DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

2) Processes
3) Technology
4) Governance.

This leads to a better understanding the *Procurement* from the perspective of operating processes, organizational excellence, and knowledge and information management. Post this analysis, various models (such as SWOT analysis) can be utilized to identify the key competencies and major areas of improvement.

ii. **Spend analysis**
In addition to above, spend data may be collated and analysed for additional optimization opportunities. This analysis provides insights into historical spend, *Supplier* base, and spend categories to identify the focus areas for improvement.

iii. **Market analysis**
Assigned key members analyse the evolution of markets, trends and conditions to assess their impact on the *Procurement*. The necessary data may be collected through primary and secondary sources. This data is updated over time, to maintain relevance. Various methodologies, such as Porter's five forces (industry rivalry, buyer power, *Supplier* power, threat to new entrant, substitution possibilities), TOWS (Threat, Opportunities, Weakness, and Strengths) and PESTLE (political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental) analysis may be used.

iv. **Benchmarking**
A 'Competitive Assessment', conducted through survey and benchmarking, may show Entity's strengths / weaknesses with respect to industry best practices.

The '*Procurement* Strategy' addresses the areas of improvements and adjustments required to remain relevant with respect to the changes in the market.

## 2.1.1.(II) Step 2 – Develop Procurement Strategy

The '*Procurement* Strategy' includes the following:

i. **Vision and Mission**
The vision and mission of the *Procurement* is derived from the vision and mission of the Entity.

ii. **Goals / Objectives**
Based on the analysis done in previous sections, assigned members develop clear objectives for the *Procurement*. Following are few examples of objectives and associated guiding principles for the *Procurement*:

DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

1) Create "Knowledge Project (Category Management)"
   The assigned *Sourcing Specialist/Lead* can create a "Knowledge Project (Category Management)" by selecting "Knowledge Project" from the "SAP Ariba Dashboard", filling the "Overview Form", and selecting the "Category Management Template".

   The assigned *Sourcing Specialist/Lead* provides UNSPSC Level 2 category in the 'Commodity' field in the "Overview Form".

   The assigned *Sourcing Specialist/Lead* may link the "Knowledge Project (Category Management)" to a previously executed "Knowledge Project (Category Management)" by selecting the 'Predecessor Project' in the "Overview Form". This helps in indicating the relationship between projects in "SAP Ariba".

   In case, the "Knowledge Project (Category Management)" created is identical (or similar) to a previously executed "Knowledge Project (Category Management)", the assigned *Sourcing Specialist/Lead* may use the 'Copy from Project' field to readily import (but not limited to) "Overview Form" details, and if required, "Project Groups" and documents from the previously executed project into the current project. This imported information is modifiable in the current "Knowledge Project (Category Management)".

   The "Knowledge Project (Category Management)" gets activated when the "Overview Form" is completed and submitted by the assigned *Sourcing Specialist/Lead*. This *Sourcing Specialist/Lead* becomes the "Project Owner" of the project.

2) Assign Procurement Manager
   The "Project Owner" assigns a *Procurement Manager* in the "Teams" tab. The *Procurement Manager* is responsible for providing oversight of the Category Management processes and ensuring execution is compliant with the Procurement Standards and other relevant regulations.

3) Conduct Category Analysis
   Category Analysis consists of two parts:

   a. **Internal Category Profile**
      The 'Internal Category Profile' includes key learnings from spend analysis of the category. It includes details such as (but not limited to) category description, annual spend and volume, *Supplier* base, top 10 *Suppliers* by spend, and spend by sub-category. Each detail provided in the 'Internal Category Profile' must be supported by relevant analysis.

      The "Documents" tab of the "Knowledge Project (Category Management)" contains an 'Internal Category Profile' document which may be downloaded, completed, and uploaded by the "Project Owner". Below is the structure of this document:

**Table 2.2.3 'Category Strategy' document structure**

The creation of the 'Category Strategy' consists of following activities:

a. **Step 1 – Undertake Category Segmentation**
   Category Segmentation depends on the following criteria:

   a1. **Criticality of the Category** is determined by factors such as (but not limited to) impact on Entity's operations in case of unavailability, and critical factors such as Health, Safety and Environment.

   a2. **Complexity of the Category** defines the inherent nature of a category that is governed by several factors including (but not limited to) availability of *Suppliers*, market structure (monopolistic, oligopolistic, competitive etc.), ability to switch *Suppliers*, possibility of substitution, lead times and regulations governing the category.

   Based on above parameters, the category may be classified into the following segments:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td rowspan="2" style="writing-mode: vertical-lr; text-orientation: mixed;">Complexity of the Category</td>
<td>Bottleneck Items</td>

<td colspan="2" style="text-align: center;">Criticality of the Category</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

*Figure 2.2.5 Category Segmentation*

b. **Step 2 - Identify and shortlist Strategic Levers**
   Based on the Category Segmentation, the "Project Owner" selects the category optimization and improvement strategies (and associated levers). These strategies (and associated levers) are divided into following areas:

29
Procurement Manual (SAP Ariba Aligned)

دائرة الإسناد الحكومي
DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

b1. **Usage and Innovation** – refers to opportunities to increase efficiency and innovate by managing demand, optimizing design specifications, and collaborating with strategic *Suppliers*.

b2. **Price** – refers to opportunities to reduce purchase price of goods/services/projects by utilizing advanced cost management, leveraging supply competition, and encouraging *Supplier* value creation.

b3. **Process and Operational Efficiency** – refers to opportunities to improve key operational processes throughout the supply chain by improving transaction processing, managing costs, and increasing integration.

b4. **Risk and Sustainability** – refers to opportunities to increase predictability and minimize environmental impact by implementing sustainable buying and leveraging risk management practices.

Details of the strategies (and associated levers) within each of the following areas are provided in the 'Strategy X Levers' tab of the 'Category Strategy' document explained in *Table 2.2.3*.

c. **Step 3 - Finalize Initiatives and Execution Plan**
   The "Project Owner" identifies initiatives against various strategic levers and develops an 'Execution Plan' for each identified initiative.

d. **Step 4 - Develop Engagement Model with the Supplier**
   Based on the category value chain identified during the 'External Market Analysis' (*Table 2.2.2*), the "Project Owner" determines the engagement model. The engagement model suggests the level at which the *Supplier* should be engaged as illustrated below:

<table>
<tr>
<td>Manufacturer</td>
<td>→</td>
<td>Wholesaler</td>
<td>→</td>
<td>Distributor</td>
<td>→</td>
<td>Reseller</td>
</tr>
</table>

*Figure 2.2.6 Engagement levels*

e. **Step 5 - Develop Business Case**
   The "Project Owner" develops a business case at the category/sub-category level. Business case provides a quantitative estimate of the potential savings that can be achieved by executing all selected initiatives within a category/sub-category. The "Project Owner" may upload additional documents to support the business case calculations.

5) **Review 'Category Strategy'**
   The "Project Owner" uploads the completed 'Category Strategy' in the "Category Strategy" folder in "Documents" tab of the "Knowledge Project (Category Management)" for review by the "Reviewers" *as per the PDoA*.

The "Reviewers" may consider (but not limited to) the following points while reviewing the 'Category Strategy':

a. The 'Internal Category Profile' and 'External Category Analysis' must address the relevant questions required to choose the strategic levers and initiatives for the category.
b. The strategic levers and initiatives identified for the category are aligned with the 'Procurement Strategy'.
c. The business case should be realistic and supported with suitable analysis.

The "Reviewer" clicks on "Complete Review" and, if required, attaches the modified 'Category Strategy'. When the "Project Owner" receives the updated 'Category Strategy' from the "Reviewer", the "Project Owner" may "Accept All changes" or initiate another round of review. The latest version of the 'Category Strategy' gets saved in the "Knowledge Project (Category Management)" (automatically) when the "Project Owner" clicks on "Accept All changes".

6) Obtain approval for the 'Category Strategy'
The "Project Owner" uploads the reviewed 'Category Strategy', in the "Category Strategy" folder in "Documents" tab, for approval by the "Approvers" designated *as per the PDoA*.

If "Approvers" reject the 'Category Strategy', they must provide a valid justification to the "Project Owner". The "Project Owner" makes the recommended modifications and re-submits the 'Category Strategy', in the "Category Strategy" folder in "Documents" tab, for approval.

In case the modified 'Category Strategy' requires review by the "Reviewers", the "Project Owner" may re-trigger the "Review" task. Otherwise, the "Project Owner" can re-trigger the "Approval" task for approval.

The approved 'Category Strategy' is shared with the relevant *Sourcing Specialists/ Leads*, *Contracting Specialists/Leads*, and *SRM Specialists* outside "SAP Ariba".

    A[Monitor 'Category Strategy' execution] --> B[Close "Knowledge Project (Category Management)"]
```

*Figure 2.2.8 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Execute and Monitor 'Category Strategy'*

1) **Monitor 'Category Strategy' execution**

   The "Project Owner" conducts periodic reviews of the 'Category Strategy' execution. These reviews are managed entirely outside "SAP Ariba".

   The "Project Owner" downloads the 'Category Strategy Progress Report' document from the "Documents" tab of the "Knowledge Project (Category Management)" and share it with individuals identified to execute the 'Category Strategy' initiatives outside "SAP Ariba".

   With each review, these individuals provide the updated status of the respective initiatives along with identified risks. The "Project Owner" collates these inputs and uploads an updated version of the 'Category Strategy Progress Report' document in the "Documents" tab of the "Knowledge Project (Category Management)".

   The "Project Owner" can modify the 'Category Strategy' during the execution if required. Any modification made to the 'Category Strategy' requires reviews and approvals, as explained in section 2.2.3.(I).

2) **Close "Knowledge Project (Category Management)"**

   The "Knowledge Project (Category Management)" is considered completed in following scenarios:

   a. All initiatives identified in the 'Category Strategy' are executed.
   b. The Category Management cycle has been completed and a new 'Category Strategy' needs to be created.

   In either case, the "Project Owner" uploads the updated version of the 'Category Strategy Progress Report' document in the "Documents" tab and closes the "Knowledge Project (Category Management)" by marking the 'Project State' field as "Completed" in the "Overview" tab.

   The closure of the "Knowledge Project (Category Management)" is communicated to the relevant individuals outside "SAP Ariba".

*Figure 2.2.10 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Prepare 'Procurement Plan'*

1) Create "Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)"

The assigned **Sourcing Specialist/Lead** can create a "Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)" by selecting the "Knowledge Project" from "SAP Ariba Dashboard", filling the "Overview Form", and selecting the "Procurement Demand Planning Template".

The assigned **Sourcing Specialist/Lead** may link the "Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)" to a previously executed "Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)" by selecting the 'Predecessor Project' field in the "Overview Form". This helps in indicating the relationship between projects in "SAP Ariba".

In case, the "Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)" created is identical (or similar) to a previously executed "Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)", the assigned **Sourcing Specialist/Lead** may use the 'Copy from Project' field to readily import (but not limited to) "Overview Form" details, and if required, "Project Groups" and documents from the previously executed project into the current project. This imported information is modifiable in the current "Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)".

The "Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)" gets activated when the "Overview Form" is completed and submitted by the assigned **Sourcing Specialist/Lead**. This **Sourcing Specialist/Lead** becomes the "Project Owner" of the project.

2) Assign "Team Members"

"Team Members" are grouped into:

a. **"Project Groups"**

The "Project Groups" enabled within the "Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)" are:

a1. **Project Owner**

The "Project Owner" is responsible for executing the tasks in the "Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)".

35

DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

a2. **Procurement Manager**
"Project Owner" assigns the *Procurement Manager* in the "Teams" tab. The *Procurement Manager* is responsible for providing oversight of the Procurement Planning processes and ensuring execution is compliant with the Procurement Standards and other relevant regulations.

a3. **Finance**
A representative from the *Finance* is added to the "Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)" to review the 'Procurement Plan' and validate the budget availability.

b. **"System Groups"**
"System Groups" are groups of participants pre-determined for a "Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)" (e.g., "Approvers" and "Reviewers"). The "Project Owner" can add members to the "System Groups" but cannot modify the existing members.

## 3) Create and Publish "Demand Plan Input Collection Survey"

The "Project Owner" sets up the "Demand Plan Input Collection Survey" by finalizing the following components:

a. **Survey Rules**
This component specifies the rules for the execution of the survey, such as:
a1. **Timing Rules** – defines time-related parameters of the survey (e.g., Planned Start date and duration).

b. **Survey Participants**
The *Budget Owners* are added as survey participants.

c. **Survey Content**
The "Demand Plan Input Collection Survey" content includes a 'Demand Gathering Form' document, which must be filled by all survey participants.

'Demand Gathering Form' document is designed to collate the demand requirements from various Entities, or various departments within an Entity, and assess the existing demand-supply gap. The procurement activities for the coming year are planned to bridge this demand-supply gap identified in the document.

*Figure 2.2.11 Procurement Plan creation*

The "Project Owner" may consider (but not limited to) following points while creating the 'Procurement Plan':

a. Download and collate various "Demand Plan Input Collection Survey" responses to complete the 'Demand and Supply Analysis' tab of the 'Procurement Plan'.

b. Indicate details such as (but not limited to) sufficiency of the existing contract to fulfil the demand, procurement cycle duration, category mapping, and priority of the sourcing initiative in the 'Demand and Supply Analysis' tab of the 'Procurement Plan'.

c. Use the sourcing and procurement initiatives identified in the various 'Category Strategy' documents to complete the 'Initiative Pipeline' tab of the 'Procurement Plan'.

d. The sourcing initiatives identified in the 'Demand and Supply Analysis' and 'Initiative Pipeline' tabs flow through to the 'Procurement Plan' tab, with respective priority.

e. The 'Procurement Plan' tab of the document acts as one of the triggers for the creation of a "Sourcing Request". The information provided in the 'Procurement Plan' is used to complete the "Overview Form" of the "Sourcing Request".

The demand requirements are collated across departments to identify overall demand for an Entity-Specific Category. The demand requirements are collated across Entities to identify overall demand for a Common Category.

The completed 'Procurement Plan' is uploaded in the "Documents" tab of the "Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)" for reviews and approvals.

1) Monitor progress against 'Procurement Plan'

   The sourcing initiatives identified in the 'Procurement Plan' are executed through the S2C processes. The "Project Owner" of the "Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)" conducts periodic reviews of the 'Procurement Plan' execution. This review is managed entirely outside "SAP Ariba".

   With each review, the individuals executing the identified sourcing initiatives provide the updated status along with identified risks. The "Project Owner" collates these inputs in the 'Procurement Plan' document. The "Project Owner" uploads an updated version of the 'Procurement Plan' document in the "Documents" tab of the "Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)".

   The "Project Owner" can modify the 'Procurement Plan' document during the execution due to any adhoc demands, delays in execution, changes in the 'Category Strategy', or changes in the 'Procurement Strategy'. Any modification made to the 'Procurement Plan' requires reviews and approvals, as explained in section 2.2.3.(IV)

2) Close "Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)"

   The "Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)" is considered "Complete" when the sourcing initiatives identified in the 'Procurement Plan' are executed.

   The "Project Owner" uploads an updated version of the 'Procurement Plan' document and closes the "Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)" project by marking the 'Project State' field as "Completed" in the "Overview" tab.

   The "Project Owner" communicates the closure of the "Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)" to the respective stakeholders, outside "SAP Ariba".

*Figure 2.3.3 S2C processes and "SAP Ariba" stages*

A "Sourcing Request" initiates the process to identify the *Supplier* for required goods/services/projects. It may be created against either an approved 'Purchase Requisition (PR)' or a sourcing initiative in the approved 'Procurement Plan'. An approved "Sourcing Request" leads to a "Sourcing Project".

A "Sourcing Project" enables execution of all tendering related tasks including (but not limited to) creation of a 'Sourcing Strategy', creation, execution, and evaluation of the Sourcing Event, and preparation of 'Award Recommendation Report'. A "Sourcing Project" may include one or more Sourcing Events.

The Sourcing Event enables interaction between *Procurement* and *Suppliers* to obtain information or bids. Following are the types of Sourcing Events:

دائرة الإسناد الحكومي
DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

1. Request for Information (RFI)
2. Request for Proposal (RFP)
3. Request for Quotation (RFQ)
4. Reverse Auctions (eAuctions)

A *Sourcing Specialist/Lead* is assigned as the "Project Owner" of the "Sourcing Project" in "SAP Ariba". This assigned *Sourcing Specialist/Lead* creates the "Sourcing Request" against which the "Sourcing Project" is created and executed. In case of an Entity Specific Category, the "Project Owner" is from the Entity managing the category while in case of a Common Category, the "Project Owner" is from the GPO.

## 2.3.3 Details of the Level 3 Processes

### 2.3.3.(I) Prepare and Approve "Sourcing Request (SR)"

i. **(B) Scope and Purpose**

Creation and approval of a "Sourcing Request (SR)" is mandatory to conduct sourcing in "SAP Ariba". The purpose of this process is to create and obtain approval for the SR.

ii. **(B) Process Flow and Key Tasks**

<table>

1) **Create SR**
   An SR may be created in following ways:

   a. **Flip an approved PR into an SR (linking "ORACLE ADERP" and "SAP Ariba")**

<td colspan="2">SAP Ariba</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

*Figure 2.3.5 Procurement processes across "ORACLE ADERP" and "SAP Ariba"*

If the goods/services/projects requested in an approved PR require sourcing, PR may be flipped into an SR to identify and finalize the **Supplier**. Since PR is created in "ORACLE ADERP", it must be flipped into an SR manually, as following:

a1. The assigned **Sourcing Specialist/Lead** creates an SR in the "Sourcing Module" against an approved PR.

a2. Details of the approved PRs are downloaded from "ORACLE ADERP" and added in the SR. Additional details may be added as an attachment in the SR for review and approval.

a3. Multiple PRs may be aggregated into a Single SR, or a single PR may be split across multiple SRs, as required.

> *Important Note: Approved PR is verified by the Procurement against existing contracts and inventories to identify if the requirement can be fulfilled without entering into new obligations.*

> *Important Note: The approved procurement requirement is not to be split into multiple SR to bypass approval authorities. Any split must be documented and approved by the Head of Procurement.*

b. **Create SR against sourcing initiatives in the approved 'Procurement Plan'**
   The assigned **Sourcing Specialist/Lead** can create an SR based on a sourcing initiative identified in the 'Procurement Plan' and provide required details.

   The assigned **Sourcing Specialist/Lead** can create an SR by selecting "Sourcing Request" from the "SAP Ariba Dashboard" and completing the "Overview Form".

   The assigned **Sourcing Specialist/Lead** provides UNSPSC Level 2 category in the 'Commodity' field in the "Overview Form".

48
Procurement Manual (SAP Ariba Aligned)

دائرة الإسناد الحكومي
DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

The assigned **Sourcing Specialist/Lead** may link the "Sourcing Request" to a previously executed "Knowledge Project (Procurement Demand Planning)" or "Sourcing Request" by selecting the 'Predecessor Project' in the "Overview Form". This helps in indicating the relationship between projects in "SAP Ariba".

In case, the "Sourcing Request" created is identical (or similar) to a previously executed "Sourcing Request" the assigned **Sourcing Specialist/Lead** may use the 'Copy from Project' field to readily import (but not limited to) "Overview Form" details, and if required, "Project Groups" and documents from the previously executed project into the current project. This imported information is modifiable in the current "Sourcing Request".

The assigned **Sourcing Specialist/Lead** specifies the 'Sourcing Method' in the "Overview Form".

2) Select the 'Sourcing Method'
   The "Project Owner" selects the type of the 'Sourcing Method' to be used for the "Sourcing Project". Following are the types of 'Sourcing Methods' available:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Aspects</th>
<th>Public Tender</th>
<th>Limited Tender</th>
<th>Sole/Single Source</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td># of Suppliers</td>
<td>Open to all <em>Suppliers</em> willing to participate</td>
<td>Open to <em>Suppliers</em> which have been screened and shortlisted to submit bids/offers</td>
<td><em>Single Supplier</em> is selected to submit bids/offers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tender Visibility</td>
<td>Any <em>Supplier</em></td>
<td>Shortlisted <em>Suppliers</em> from <em>Supplier Master Database</em> maintained by the <em>DGS</em></td>
<td>Selected <em>Supplier</em> from <em>Supplier Master Database</em> maintained by the <em>DGS</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tender Participation</td>
<td><em>Suppliers</em> registered on "SAP Ariba Network"</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tender Award</td>
<td colspan="3">Winning <em>Supplier</em> – must be "Qualified" in the <em>Supplier Database</em> maintained by the <em>DGS</em><br>(DGS - Department of Government Support)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**Table 2.3.1 Summary of features – Sourcing Methods**

*Important Note: Interested Suppliers, that are not registered in the Supplier Master Database, maintained by the DGS, may participate in Public Tenders. However, they must be registered in the "SAP Ariba Network".*

*Important Note: Sole/Single source should only be selected as the last option, and Procurement must endeavor to suggest suitable alternatives wherever possible.*

In case the assigned **Sourcing Specialist/Lead** selects the Single/Sole source as the 'Sourcing Method' or deviates from the 'Sourcing Method' prescribed in the PDoA, the rationale and business case for the same must be provided for approval. Recommended Sourcing Method, in relation to the tender value, have been specified <ins>in the PDoA</ins>.

The SR gets activated once the "Overview Form" is submitted by the assigned *Sourcing Specialist/Lead*. This assigned *Sourcing Specialist/Lead* becomes the "Project Owner" of the SR automatically.

3) Add Procurement Manager
   The "Project Owner" assigns the *Procurement Manager*. The *Procurement Manager* is responsible for providing oversight of the S2C processes and ensure execution is compliant with the Procurement Standards and other relevant regulations.

4) Add SR Line Items/additional documents
   The "Project Owner" edits the SR attributes and provide line-item details. If the SR has been created from an approved PR, this information is imported from the PR. The "Project Owner" may submit additional documents (e.g., SOW) with the SR for review and approval.

5) Obtain all approvals for SR
   The completed SR is reviewed and approved by the "Approvers" designated *as per the PDoA*. "Approval" tasks are initiated automatically in "Sourcing Module" once all predecessor tasks are "Completed".

   If "Approvers" reject the SR, they must provide a valid justification to the "Project Owner". The "Project Owner" makes the recommended modifications and re-submits the SR for approval.

   Once the SR is approved, a "Sourcing Project" template appears in the "Documents" tab of the SR, automatically. This template is then used to execute and manage the "Sourcing Project" associated with the approved SR.

2) Select the 'Project Type'
   Following are the 'Project Types' available in "SAP Ariba":

   a. **"Full Sourcing Project"** is the preferred choice for a high spend - strategic sourcing initiatives which may require a 'Sourcing Strategy', multiple Sourcing Events, and technical and commercial bid submission in separate "Envelopes".

*Important Note: Public Tenders can only be executed using "Full Sourcing Projects".*

   b. **"Quick Sourcing Project"** is the preferred choice for a low spend - non-strategic sourcing Initiatives which may not require a 'Sourcing Strategy' or multiple Sourcing Events, and where bids may be submitted in a single "Envelope".

Below is an illustration of the differences between a "Full Sourcing Project" and a "Quick Sourcing Project":

<table>
<thead>
<tr>

Single or multiple "Sourcing Projects" can be created against an approved SR. The "Project Owner" has an option to select a different 'Sourcing Method' for each "Sourcing Project" within SR.

The Procurement Manual, by default, covers S2C processes from a "Full Sourcing Project" perspective. In case a process is not applicable (or is different) for a "Quick Sourcing Project", it has been highlighted in the respective section.

Recommended 'Project Types', in relation to the tender value, have been illustrated in *Figure 2.3.2*. Any deviation from the recommended 'Project Types' must be accompanied by a valid justification and should be approved by relevant authorities *as per the PDoA*.

DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

# 3) Select the 'Event Type'

Following are the 'Event Types' enabled in "SAP Ariba":

## a. Request for Information (RFI)
Used to gather information (market/spend/*Supplier* base) or to shortlist *Suppliers* for RFP/RFQ.

## b. Request for Proposal (RFP)
Used for seeking proposals from *Suppliers*; best suited for services or cases where the *Procurement* relies on the experience and creativity of *Suppliers* to define the best solution. RFP may be followed by RFQ or negotiations.

## c. Request for Quotation (RFQ)
Used for seeking pricing information for a well-defined scope of work or supply of specified goods/services/projects, usually preferred for commoditized goods/services/projects where substitutes/ alternatives are allowed.

## d. Reverse Auction (eAuction)
Used as an alternative to the RFQ for highly commoditized goods/services, or where participating *Suppliers* have fully acknowledged specifications (substitutes/alternatives not allowed); usually multiple *Suppliers* are invited to participate in eAuctions to maximize savings. During eAuctions, the *Suppliers* can see their relative ranking and can adjust their bids in real-time.

*Important Note: The "Project Owner" may select multiple Sourcing Events within a "Full Sourcing Project," depending on the requirement. However, only one Sourcing Event per 'Event Type' can be executed within a "Full Sourcing Project" (e.g., 2 RFPs or 2 RFQs are not allowed).*

*Important Note: The "Project Owner" cannot run parallel Sourcing Events within a "Sourcing Project". There must only be a single "Award Scenario" per "Sourcing Project".*

*Important Note: The "Project Owner" may keep an additional Sourcing Event (RFP/RFQ) in the "Sourcing Project" to obtain and record post-negotiation responses from the Suppliers, if required.*

The "Project Owner" may link the "Sourcing Project" to a previously executed "Sourcing Project" by selecting the 'Predecessor Project' in the "Overview Form". This helps in indicating the relationship between projects in "SAP Ariba".

In case, the "Sourcing Project" created is identical (or similar) to a previously executed "Sourcing Project", the "Project Owner" may use the 'Copy from Project' field to readily import (but not limited to) "Overview Form" details, and if required, "Project Groups" and documents from the previously executed project into the current project. This imported information is modifiable in the current "Sourcing Project".

*Important Note: Only a "Full Sourcing Project" can be copied to another "Full Sourcing Project". The same is the case for a "Quick Sourcing Project".*

DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

Once the "Overview Form" is completed and submitted by the "Project Owner", in case of a "Full Sourcing project", the "Sourcing Project" gets activated and in case of a "Quick Sourcing Project", the "Project Owner" is directed to the 'Prepare and Publish Sourcing Event' process directly.

4) Assign "Team Members"
   The "Team Members" are grouped into:

   a. "Project Groups"
      The "Project Groups" enabled within "Sourcing module" are:

      a1. "Project Owner"
          The "Project Owner" is responsible for the execution of "Sourcing Project" tasks.

      a2. "Contract Manager" (not enabled in the "Quick Sourcing Projects")
          The *Contract Specialist/Lead* assigned as the "Contract Manager" is responsible for creating, updating, and maintaining contract templates for goods/services/projects associated with the "Sourcing Project".

      a3. Procurement Manager
          *Procurement Manager* is responsible for providing oversight of the S2C processes and ensures the execution is compliant with the Procurement Standards and other relevant regulations.

      a4. "Project Observers"
          "Project Observers" are responsible for only observing the progress of the "Sourcing Project". Participants of this group are pre-determined. The "Project Owner" can add members to this group but cannot modify the existing members.

      a5. "Team Graders" (not enabled in the "Quick Sourcing Projects")
          "Team Graders" are responsible for performing technical evaluations and commercial evaluations (if required) of the *Supplier* responses to the Sourcing Event. They may participate in negotiations, review the 'Sourcing Strategy', and provide inputs to the 'Negotiations Plan' and 'Award Recommendation Report'.

          In case the *Tendering Committee* is mandated by the PDoA (please refer to *Figure 2.3.2*), members of the *Tendering Committee* are added as "Team Graders". In case the *Tendering Committee* is not mandated, the "Project Owner" may add individuals from other functions and the *Procurement* as "Team Graders".

*Important Note: Members of the Tendering Committee are nominated by the respective department heads and endorsed by the Head of Procurement. This endorsement is managed outside "SAP Ariba".*

The "Project Owner" can download the 'Tendering Committee Creation Form' document from the "Documents" tab of the "Sourcing Project" to confirm the *Tendering Committee* members. The "Project Owner" uploads the completed 'Tendering Committee Creation Form' document in the "Documents" tab of the "Sourcing Project".

For Entity-Specific Category, members of "Project Groups" are from the Entity managing the category. In the case of a Common Category, the "Project Owner" is from the GPO, while stakeholders from other Entities may be assigned as "Team Graders" if required.

b. **"System Groups"**
"System Groups" are groups of participants pre-determined for a "Sourcing Project" (e.g., "Approvers" and "Reviewers"). The "Project Owner" can add members to the "System Groups" but cannot modify the existing members.

*Important Note: Assigning "Team Members" is the first task within a "Full Sourcing Project". For a "Quick Sourcing Project", the "Team Members" are assigned within the Sourcing Event.*

The "Project Owner" may use the 'Sourcing Strategy' template provided in the "Sourcing Project" or other approved template covering the required elements.

The "Project Owner" considers the following points while creating the 'Sourcing Strategy':

a. Complete all the 'Sourcing Strategy' sections mentioned above, in collaboration with the *End-User*, the *Tendering Committee*, and the Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), as required.

b. In case the 'Internal Category Profile' and 'External Category Analysis' are available in the 'Category Strategy' document, the "Project Owner" is advised to use them to complete respective sections of the 'Sourcing Strategy'.

c. In case the 'Internal Category Profile' and 'External Category Analysis' are not available, create these sections using the methods explained in *section 2.2.3.(I)ii.3)*.

d. In the absence of required information, conduct RFI event and/or market research activities to create the 'Sourcing Strategy'.

e. Indicate the Sourcing Method and Sourcing Event type in the 'Sourcing Strategy' in line with details provided in the "Overview Form" explained in *section 2.3.3.(I)ii.2)* and *section 2.3.3.(II)ii.3)*.

f. The Supplier Long List section of the 'Sourcing Strategy' is only applicable for Limited Tenders. It must only include **Suppliers** from the Supplier Master Database maintained by the DGS.

2) **Review 'Sourcing Strategy'**

The "Project Owner" uploads the completed 'Sourcing Strategy' in the "Documents" tab of the "Sourcing Project" for review by the "Team Graders". "Review" tasks are initiated automatically in "Sourcing Module" once all predecessor tasks are "Completed".

The "Team Graders" may recommend modifications to the 'Sourcing Strategy' or even upload an updated version of the 'Sourcing Strategy', post review.

The "Team Graders" clicks on "Complete Review" and if required, attach the modified 'Sourcing Strategy'. When the "Project Owner" receives the updated 'Sourcing Strategy' from the "Team Graders", the "Project Owner" may "Accept All changes" or initiate another round of review. The latest version of the 'Sourcing Strategy' gets saved in the "Documents" tab of the "Sourcing Project" (automatically) when the "Project Owner" clicks on "Accept All changes".

3) **Obtain approvals for the 'Sourcing Strategy'**

The 'Sourcing Strategy' is approved by the "Approvers" designated *as per the PDoA*. "Approval" tasks are initiated automatically in "Sourcing Module" once all predecessor tasks are "Completed".

If "Approvers" reject the 'Sourcing Strategy', they must provide a valid justification to the "Project Owner". The "Project Owner" makes the recommended modifications and re-submits the 'Sourcing Strategy' for approval.

DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

If the "Approvers" approve the 'Sourcing Strategy', the "Project Owner" proceeds to the next task.

The "Project Owner" can modify an approved 'Sourcing Strategy' during the "Sourcing Project" execution, with a valid rationale. Post any modification, the 'Sourcing Strategy' is reviewed and approved, as explained in previous steps.

The "Project Owner" ensures that the "Sourcing Project" is executed in line with the latest approved version of the 'Sourcing Strategy'.

4) Review and agree to Confidentiality Requirements and No Conflict of Interest

Sourcing Events are activated in "Full Sourcing Projects" only after the "Project Owner" reviews and agrees to the Confidentiality Requirements and No Conflict of Interest.

In case the "Project Owner" has a potential/actual conflict of interest, the "Project Owner" records the same in "Comments" section of the task and informs the "Supervisor". The **Head of Procurement** appoints another "Project Owner" in this case.

DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

## a. Event Rules

This segment specifies the rules for the execution of the Sourcing Event which may include (but not limited to):

a1. **Timing Rules** – defines time-related parameters of the Sourcing Event (e.g., Planned Start date and time)

a2. **Bidding Rules** – sets rules for bidding for the Sourcing Event (e.g., enable blind grading for the event)

a3. **Currency Rules** – sets rules related to the currency of bidding for Bidder(s) (e.g., should Suppliers be allowed to select bidding currency or should it be fixed to AED).

## b. Assign "Team Members" (Quick Projects)

For "Quick Sourcing Projects", the "Team Members" are assigned within the Sourcing Event. Please refer to section 2.3.3. (II)-(ii)-2.3.3.(II)ii.4) for details of this process.

*Important Note: "Project Owner" and the Procurement Manager are the only "Project Groups" enabled in "Quick Sourcing Projects".*

## c. Select Suppliers

The "Project Owner" considers following points while selecting **Suppliers** for a Sourcing Event:

c1. Screen and shortlist **Suppliers** considering the criteria laid out in the Procurement Standards, which may include (but are not limited to) financial health, commercial standing, legal standing, historical **Supplier** performance, and technical capabilities.

c2. The shortlisting of **Suppliers** can be done via RFI, market research, or industry reports.

d. **Event Content**
   Includes sections/questions/requirements to which the *Suppliers* must respond to be evaluated and awarded. The Sourcing Event content varies depending on the Sourcing Event type (RFI, RFP, RFQ, eAuctions).

   Sourcing Event content consists of the following sections:

   d1. **Pre-requisites**
       The pre-requisites provide the context of the Sourcing Event to the *Suppliers*. They include the essential terms and conditions which the *Suppliers* must review and agree to before they are allowed to view and respond to the Sourcing Event. The pre-requisites may include (but not limited to):

       d11. Event Overview
       d12. Expression of Interest
       d13. Non-Disclosure Agreement

   d2. **Main Content of the Event**
       The main content of the Sourcing Event consists of sections/questions/requirements to obtain *Suppliers'* responses. Sourcing Event content may include (but not limited to):

       d21. **Event definitions, scope, terms, and conditions** - provide necessary information to participate in the Sourcing Event.

       d22. **Bid Bond** ensures that the awarded *Suppliers* fulfill the commitments of the accepted bid. It is only required for Sourcing Events, which may result in binding commercial proposals. The provisions of the Bid Bond with respect to the tender value is illustrated in *Figure 2.3.2*. Any deviation from the recommended provisions must be accompanied by a valid justification and should be approved by relevant authorities *as per the PDoA*.
            Please refer to *section 1.5* to review the list of *Suppliers* exempted from the Bid Bond submission.

       d23. **Draft Contract** is the agreement proposed to be finalized and signed, post conclusion of the "Sourcing Project" for *Suppliers* to review and provide departures if required.

       d24. **"Technical Envelope"** contains sections/questions/requirements to evaluate the technical capability of the *Supplier* to supply the required goods/services/projects.

       d25. **"Commercial Envelope"** contains sections/questions/requirements for the *Suppliers* to provide commercial bids. In case, the line items have been added

during "Sourcing Request", they flow through to the "Commercial Envelope" of the Sourcing Event. "Commercial Envelope" include (but not limited to):

I) **Bid Sheets** - The "Project Owner" can create the commercial bid sheets in "SAP Ariba" in the following ways:
   (i) Create each line item in "SAP Ariba".
   (ii) Upload the line item information using the "SAP Ariba" preferred excel format.

   In this case, the commercial bids are provided, monitored, and evaluated within "SAP Ariba", using the "Bid Console" functionality (e.g., eAuctions).

   The "Project Owner" may provide the commercial bid sheet in an excel format, which the **Suppliers** download, complete, and upload as part of the overall Sourcing Event response.

   The "Project Owner", in collaboration with the **End-User**, may make all line items mandatory for **Suppliers** to respond.

*Important Note: At least one-line item must be added directly in "SAP Ariba" to enable awarding of the event. (e.g., In case the Bid sheet is provided in the form of an excel file, the line item added in "SAP Ariba" can be the 'Total Cost' to which the Suppliers must respond).*

*Important Note: In the case of eAuctions, line items must be created in "SAP Ariba" to enable the "Bid Console" functionality.*

   Post finalizing the content of the Sourcing Event, the "Project Owner" may add scoring criteria (weight/importance/target grade) to enable evaluation of the Sourcing Event within "SAP Ariba". In case the scoring criteria are not set up in "SAP Ariba", the Sourcing Event can only be evaluated offline.

II) **ICV Question** - As part of the "Commercial Envelopes", the "Project Owner" requests the **Suppliers** to provide the In-Country Value (ICV) Certificate in line with the Abu Dhabi Local Content (ADLC) program initiated by the Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development (AD-DED). Please refer to **Error! Reference source not found.**Section 1.5.1 for the details of the ADLC program.

In case of single-stage evaluations ("Quick Projects"), the "Technical Envelope" and "Commercial Envelope" are merged into a "Technical and Commercial Envelope" with both aspects being recorded and evaluated simultaneously. The "Technical and Commercial Envelope" can be imported from the "Sourcing Library" provided in "SAP Ariba".

*Important Note: Adding the "Technical and Commercial Envelope" is mandatory for RFI and RFQ within a "Quick Sourcing Project".*

63
Procurement Manual (SAP Ariba Aligned)

دائرة الإسناد الحكومي
DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

The "Project Owner" may modify the "Pre-requisites", "Main Content", and "Scoring Methodology" of the Sourcing Event as required. The "Project Owner" may make a section/question within the Sourcing Event content mandatory for the **Suppliers** to respond. These sections/questions appear with a (*) mark in "SAP Ariba".

*Important Note: "SAP Ariba" allows for attachment of files up to 100MB (per file). In case, the "Project Owner" anticipates the Supplier to upload attachments above this limit, the "Project Owner" may split the sections/questions in "Technical Envelope" or "Commercial Envelope" (as required) to enable uploading of multiple smaller attachments.*

2) Create draft "Contract Workspace"
   A "Contract Workspace" may be created from within the "Sourcing Project" to initiate the internal review of the 'Main Contract Document' as explained in the section 2.3.3.(IV)-(ii)-2).

3) Obtain approvals for the Sourcing Event
   The completed Sourcing Event is submitted by the "Project Owner" for approval by "Approvers" designated *as per the PDoA*. "Approval" tasks are initiated automatically in "Sourcing Module" once all predecessor tasks are "Completed".

   If "Approvers" reject the Sourcing Event, they must provide a valid justification to the "Project Owner". The "Project Owner" makes the recommended modifications and re-submits the Sourcing Event for approval.

   If the "Approvers" approve the Sourcing Event, it is published for the **Suppliers** to view and respond.

DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

**Suppliers** appear in the "Message" tab within the Sourcing Event. The "Message Board" acts as a two-way communication channel between **Suppliers** and "Project Owner" during the execution of the Sourcing Event.

*Important Note: Responses provided by the "Project Owner" are made available to all participating Suppliers to maintain transparency. The "Project Owner" ensures that the identity of the Supplier seeking clarification is kept confidential. It is recommended to keep the "Message Board" open until awarding for the event is complete.*

3) Modify Sourcing Event/ extend Sourcing Event timelines
   If required, the "Project Owner" may modify a Sourcing Event, provided modifications made are compliant with the Procurement Standards. The "Project Owner" **cannot** invite any new **Suppliers** while modifying a published event.

*Important Note: In case a new Supplier is to be added, the published event is cancelled, and another event published with the updated list of Suppliers identified for participation. This is considered a new Sourcing Event.*

The "Project Owner" may extend Sourcing Event timelines under the following scenarios:
a. Modifications/additions have been made to the published Sourcing Event content, due to which **Suppliers** require additional time to respond to the event.
b. **Suppliers** have requested additional time to respond to the published event;

There must be a valid justification for modifying a published Sourcing Event. This rationale is reviewed and approved by "Approvers" *as per the PDoA*. Modifications made to the Sourcing Event must be uniform for all **Suppliers**.

4) Monitor the submission of Suppliers' responses
   The **Suppliers** must respond to the Sourcing Event in line with the terms and conditions of the Sourcing Event. **Suppliers** can revise their submitted responses, as long as the Sourcing Event is active. The "Project Owner" can monitor the submission of Sourcing Event responses by the **Suppliers** within "SAP Ariba".

*Important Note: The responses provided by the Suppliers can be viewed only after opening the respective "Envelopes".*

## 2.3.3.(VI) Evaluate Sourcing Event

i. (B) Scope and Purpose

The technical and commercial evaluations of a Souring Event are conducted in one of the following ways:

1) **Single–Stage Evaluation**
   In a single-stage evaluation, the technical and commercial evaluation is conducted together in a single "Envelope". (e.g., RFQ within a "Quick Sourcing Project"). Single-Stage evaluation may imply that only one of the evaluations is required.

2) **Two-Stage Evaluation**
   In a two-stage evaluation, commercial and technical evaluations are conducted in separate "Envelopes". In such cases, the commercial evaluations are conducted only for *Suppliers* that have qualified the technical evaluations. (e.g., RFP/RFQ within "Full Sourcing Project")

> **Important Note:** In case of eAuctions, the "Bid Console" functionality of "SAP Ariba" can automatically indicate the lowest bid for all line items. Further evaluations for eAuctions, if required, is conducted outside "SAP Ariba".

The purpose of the process is to conduct technical and commercial evaluations of *Suppliers'* responses, as required.

1) **Open "Technical Envelopes"**
   For "Full Sourcing Projects", the "Project Owner" opens the "Technical Envelopes" for initiating the technical evaluations. The "Team Graders" receive a system-generated email when the "Technical Envelopes" are opened.

2) **Review pre-requisites for evaluation**
   The "Team Graders" must review and agree to the Confidentiality Requirements and No Conflict of Interest before conducting the technical evaluation. These requirements are provided within the "Review Conflict of Interest and Perform Technical Evaluation" task description.

   In case a "Team Grader" does not agree to the Confidentiality Requirements and No Conflict of Interest, a valid reason for the same is provided to the "Project Owner" via the comments section in the task. The "Team Grader" leaves the task un-attempted in this case.

   In such cases, the "Team Grader" is replaced by the "Project Owner" upon recommendation of the respective function head. Replacement of the "Team Grader" is endorsed by the **Head of Procurement**, outside "SAP Ariba".

   The Confidentiality Requirements and No Conflict of Interest are deemed accepted (automatically) by the "Team Graders" when they complete the "Review Conflict of Interest and Perform Technical Evaluation" task.

3) **Conduct technical evaluations**
   Following methods are provided in "SAP Ariba" to conduct technical evaluations:
   a. **Grade by Content** enables grading of each response, across **Suppliers**, within "SAP Ariba"; this method may be used for comparative grading across **Suppliers** responses.
   b. **Grade by Participants** enables grading of responses, one **Supplier** at a time.
   c. **Grade Offline Using Excel** enables grading in an excel spreadsheet, outside "SAP Ariba"

   The Technical Evaluation within "Sourcing Module" is based on the "Scoring Methodology" defined in the Sourcing Event.

***Important Note:** In case of an RFI event, the Sourcing Event evaluation may result in a list of 'Screened and Shortlisted Suppliers' for subsequent Sourcing Events.*

4) Conduct commercial evaluations
   In case of a two-stage evaluation, once the technical evaluation is completed, the "Project Owner" opens the "Commercial Envelopes" for technically qualified *Suppliers*. The commercial evaluation is conducted by the "Project Owner", engaging the *End-user* and the *Finance*, if required.

   The "Project Owner" may engage the "Team Graders" to conduct the commercial evaluation, when recommended by the PDoA.

*Important Note: In case of "Quick Sourcing Project" the Sourcing Event evaluation is managed outside "SAP Ariba".*

Depending upon whether negotiations are required or not, the Evaluate Sourcing Event process may either lead to Conduct Negotiation process or the Award and Event Close Out process.

## 2.3.3.(VII) Conduct Negotiations (optional process)

### i. (B) Scope and Purpose

The "Project Owner" may conduct negotiations to realize additional value for the "Sourcing Project". Negotiations may not be required if the time and effort required to conduct negotiations outweigh the benefits of the same.

The "Conduct Negotiations" task is only enabled in the "Full Sourcing Project". In case negotiations are required for a "Quick Sourcing Project", they are managed outside "SAP Ariba".

Following (but not limited to) aspects of the *Supplier's* response may be negotiated:
1) Departures from the proposed contract
2) Commercial and Technical offer made by the *Supplier*

The purpose of this process is to conduct negotiations if required.

1) **Shortlist Suppliers for negotiations**
   The "Project Owner" shortlists *Suppliers* for negotiations and create a 'Negotiations Bidders List Request' based on the technical and commercial evaluations.

2) **Prepare 'Negotiation Plan'**
   The "Project Owner", in collaboration with the *End-User* or *Tendering Committee*, develops a 'Negotiation Plan' to conduct negotiations. The 'Negotiation Plan' is a document detailing (but not limited to) the purpose, the target, and the proposed methodology of negotiations. The document provides details of the negotiation strategies that may be used.

   The "Documents" tab of the "Sourcing Project" contains a 'Negotiation Plan' document which may be downloaded, completed, and uploaded by the "Project Owner". Below is the structure of this document:

**Table 2.3.9 'Negotiation Plan' document sections**

The "Project Owner" may use the 'Negotiation Plan' template provided in the "Sourcing Project" or other approved template covering the required elements.

The "Project Owner" establishes a team to conduct negotiations. A 'Negotiations Team' may include (but not limited to) Lead Negotiator, Summarizer, Observer, Minutes Taker, Subject Matter Expert, Financial Analyst, and Legal Advisor. The 'Negotiations Team' is encouraged to:

a. Identify the Maximum Supportable Situation (MSS), Least Acceptable Solution (LAS), and Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement (BATNA).
b. Collect and analyze industry and competitor information.
c. Make a list of the most critical arguments and understand the points of leverage.
d. Plan the details of the negotiations and conduct internal trial runs, if required.

> **Important Note:** *An individual can perform multiple roles within the 'Negotiations Team' (if required). The 'Negotiations Team' must consist of a minimum of two members.*

3) **Invite Suppliers and conduct negotiations**

The "Project Owner" invites identified *Suppliers* for negotiations via the "Message Board" functionality. Post-negotiations, if an agreement is reached between the *Supplier* and the *Procurement*, the "Project Owner" publishes the post negotiation Sourcing Event to record updated *Supplier* responses.

In cases an agreement cannot be reached post-negotiations, the "Project Owner" may take one of the following approaches:

a. If the original bids are acceptable, the "Project Owner" proceeds to the "Approve Recommendation of Award" task considering the original bids.
b. If the original bids are unacceptable, the "Project Owner" cancels the Sourcing Event. The "Project Owner" may modify the 'Sourcing Strategy' or just conduct another Sourcing Event, to obtain the desired results.

*Figure 2.3.22 Process Flow and Key Tasks – Create and Execute Post-Negotiations Sourcing Event*

1) **Create post negotiation Sourcing Event**
   The "Project Owner" can create a post-negotiations Sourcing Event in following ways:
   
   a. **Using additional Sourcing Event in the original "Sourcing Project"**
      As recommended in Reverse Auction (eAuction), the "Project Owner" may use the additional Sourcing Event within the "Full Sourcing Project" to obtain negotiated bids from the *Suppliers*.
   
   b. **Post-negotiations Quick Project**
      The "Project Owner" may create an additional "Quick Sourcing Project" (linked to the original SR) for *Suppliers* to provide negotiated bids. This is done by creating another "Subproject" from the "Documents" tab of the associated "Sourcing Request".

> *Important Note: If another "Quick Sourcing Project" is used to obtain negotiated bids, the original "Sourcing Project" must be closed by changing the 'Project State' to "Completed" in the "Overview" tab.*

2) **Prepare, publish and execute the Sourcing Event**
   In case, an additional Sourcing Event within the original "Full Sourcing Project" is used for recording negotiated bids in "SAP Ariba", the "Project Owner" completes all activities specified in Prepare and Publish Sourcing Event for a "Full Sourcing Project".
   
   In case an additional "Quick Sourcing Project" is created to record post-negotiations bids in "SAP Ariba", the "Project Owner" completes all activities specified for "Quick Sourcing Projects" in Create "Sourcing Project" and Prepare and Publish Sourcing Event.
   
   In either case, the "Project Owner" may download the content of the original Sourcing Event and upload it in the new Sourcing Event. The Sourcing Event content can be modified in the new Sourcing Event, as required.

> *Important Note: The "Project Owner" must invite all Suppliers that participated in the negotiations to provide negotiated responses in the post-negotiations Sourcing Event.*

1) **Ensure all winning Suppliers are "Qualified"**
   The "Project Owner" ensures that *Suppliers* considered for an award are "Qualified" in the Supplier Master Database maintained by the DGS. The process to "Qualify" a *Supplier* in the Supplier Master Database is explained in the *section 2.8.3.(IV)*.

*Important Note: Disqualified Suppliers should not be considered for awards.*

2) **Prepare the 'Award Recommendation Report' and "Award Scenarios"**
   The "Project Owner" creates the following:

   a. **'Award Recommendation Report'**
      The 'Award Recommendation Report' summarizes the execution of "Souring Project" and provides details of award.

      In case that the negotiations were not conducted, the "Project Owner" creates the 'Award Recommendation Report' after the Sourcing Event evaluation and attach it along with the "Award Scenarios" for approval by the "Approvers" designated *as per the PDoA*.

      In case negotiations were conducted, the "Project Owner" creates the 'Award Recommendation Report' post-negotiations and attaches it along with the "Award Scenarios" for approval by the "Approvers" designated *as per the PDoA*.

      The "Documents" tab of the "Sourcing Project" contains an 'Award Recommendation Report' document, which may be downloaded, completed, and uploaded by the "Project Owner". Below is the structure of this document:

**Table 2.3.12 'Award Recommendation Report' in "SAP Ariba"**

The "Project Owner" may use the 'Award Recommendation Report' template provided in the "Sourcing Project" or other approved template covering the required elements.

> **Important Note: In case of "Quick Sourcing Project", the 'Award Recommendation Report' is provided in the "Sourcing Library" from where it can be downloaded, completed, and attached with the "Award Scenarios".**

b. **"Award Scenarios"**

Creating "Award Scenarios" is the process to allocate the line items to winning **Suppliers** in "SAP Ariba". This allocation follows through to "Contract Workspace" and to "Procure to Order (P2O) module" (once enabled).

In case the "Bid Console" functionality is used, the "Project Owner" can define a criterion in "Bid Console" to automatically allocate line items to the successful **Suppliers**. Alternatively, the "Project Owner" may allocate line items manually. A line item may be split among winning **Suppliers** if required. Please refer to **section 10.22** of the Procurement Standards to understand how to resolve a tie among **Suppliers**.

> **Important Note: Approval of "Awards Scenarios" is mandatory for "Sourcing Project" completion in "SAP Ariba".**

3) **Obtain approvals for "Award Scenario" and 'Award Recommendation Report'**

The completed "Awards Scenario" and the 'Award Recommendation Report' are approved by the "Approvers" designated **as per the PDoA**. "Approval" tasks are initiated in "Sourcing Module" once all predecessor tasks are "Completed".

If "Approvers" reject the "Awards Scenario" and the 'Award Recommendation Report', they must provide a valid justification to the "Project Owner". The "Project Owner" makes the

76
Procurement Manual (SAP Ariba Aligned)


---



دائرة الإسناد الحكومي
DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

recommended modifications and re-submits the "Awards Scenario" and the 'Award Recommendation Report' for approval.

As soon as the "Approvers" approve the "Awards Scenario" and the 'Award Recommendation Report', the "Sourcing Project" automatically closes for any further modifications.

4) Communicate award to winning Suppliers.
   Once the "Award Scenarios" are "Approved", "SAP Ariba" can automatically send a system-generated email to the winning *Suppliers*, providing them with the details of the line items awarded to them. The "Project Owner" needs to enable this automated email when creating the "Award Scenarios".

5) Accept/reject the award
   The "Project Owner" tracks the acceptance/rejection of the award by winning *Suppliers*. In case the winning *Suppliers* reject the award, the "Project Owner" may take one of the following steps:

   a. **Consider the next eligible Supplier for award**

      The "Project Owner" can create another "Quick Sourcing Project" (linked to the same SR) where the next eligible *Supplier* is invited to provide final bids. Please refer to *section 2.3.3. (VIII)-(2.3.3.(VII)ii)* for the details of the process.

   b. **Modify 'Sourcing Strategy'**
      The "Project Owner" cancels this Sourcing Event and modifies the 'Sourcing Strategy'. The Sourcing Events are created and executed following the newly approved 'Sourcing Strategy' to fulfil the requirements.

      The selected way forward is endorsed by the *Head of Procurement*.

*Important Note: If a 'Bid Bond Certificate' has been provisioned in the Sourcing Event, the "Project Owner" must inform the Finance to appropriate the Bid Bond for winning Suppliers who have rejected the award. The "Project Owner" may recommend adding such Suppliers to the list of blacklisted Suppliers in the Supplier Master Database maintained by the DGS.*

*Important Note: The "Sourcing Project" must be closed by changing the 'Project State' to "Completed" in the "Overview" tab, even if it is not awarded.*

## 2.3.3.(X) Cancel Sourcing Event/"Sourcing Project"/"Sourcing Request"

i. **(B) Scope and Purpose**

Cancellation of a Sourcing Event/"Sourcing Project"/"Sourcing Request" implies lost time and resources and should only be done as a last resort.

However, in certain circumstances, it might be necessary to cancel a Sourcing Event/"Sourcing Project"/"Sourcing Request". Such scenarios may include (but not limited to):

1) "Sourcing Request" is no longer valid (requested goods/services/projects are not required anymore).
2) *Suppliers* shortlisted for the Sourcing Event did not respond to the event.
3) *Suppliers* responses to a Sourcing Event are invalid and cannot be evaluated.
4) No agreement reached post-negotiations, and original bids are not acceptable.

The purpose of this process is to cancel the Sourcing Event/"Sourcing Project"/"Sourcing Request" in "SAP Ariba", as required and inform the participating *Suppliers*.

1) Add "Cancel Sourcing Event" task
   The "Cancel Sourcing Event" is not a default task within the "Sourcing Project". In case the Sourcing Event needs to be cancelled, the "Project Owner" adds the "Cancel Sourcing Event" task via the "Overview" tab.

2) Create and obtain approvals for 'Event Cancellation Request'
   The "Project Owner" creates an 'Event Cancellation Request' and submit it for approval by the "Approvers" designated <ins>as per the PDoA</ins>.

   The "Documents" tab of the "Sourcing Project" contains an 'Event Cancellation Request' document, which may be downloaded, completed, and uploaded by the "Project Owner". The "Project Owner" may use the 'Event Cancellation Request' template provided in the "Sourcing Project" or other approved template covering the required elements.

3) Cancel the Sourcing Event
   In case the 'Event Cancellation Request' is approved, the "Project Owner" cancels the respective Sourcing Event in "SAP Ariba". The "Project Owner" can cancel the event by updating the event details and marking the event "Cancelled".

*Important Note: In the case of "Quick Sourcing Project", the "Project Owner" executes the above process steps outside "SAP Ariba". The "Approvers" for 'Event Cancellation Request' are same as the "Approvers" for Prepare and Publish Sourcing Event process.*

4) Send 'Event Cancellation Notice' to Suppliers
   'Event Cancellation Notice' is the automated email sent to all participating **Suppliers** when the Sourcing Event gets cancelled.

5) Cancel "Sourcing Project"/"Sourcing Request"
   A "Sourcing Project" should only be cancelled if all events within the "Sourcing Project" are cancelled. Similarly, a "Sourcing Request" should be cancelled only if all "Sourcing Projects" associated with the "Sourcing Request" are cancelled.

79

DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

"Sourcing Project"/"Sourcing Request" can be cancelled by changing the respective status in the "Overview" tab. The "Project Owner" must obtain relevant approvals *as per the PDoA* before cancelling a "Sourcing Project"/"Sourcing Request". These approvals are managed outside "SAP Ariba".

Each contract associates to a "Contract Workspace" (in the "CLM module") which has pre-defined "Tasks", "Team Members", "Documents", and approval chains configured to enable efficient creation and management of any contract.

The CLM processes are executed in the "Contract Workspace," as illustrated below:

*Figure 2.4.4 CLM processes and "SAP Ariba" stages*

The **Publish Contract** enables the creation, review, approval, and publishing of the contract in the "Contract Workspace". The **Manage Contract** enables the management of contract amendments, claims, penalties, and disputes that may arise during the lifecycle of the contract. The **Close Contract** enables the closure/termination of the "Contract Workspace" and completion of associated tasks.

A *Contracting Specialist/Lead* is assigned as the "Project Owner" of the "Contract Workspace". For a "Contract Workspace" created against an Entity-Specific Category, the "Project Owner" is from the Entity managing the category. For a "Contract Workspace" created against a Common Category, the "Project Owner" is from the GPO. The "Contract Workspace" for call-off contract (executed pursuant to the Common Category) is created and managed by the Entity executing the same.

## 2.4.3 Details of the Level 3 Processes

### 2.4.3.(I) Initiate and Review Contract

i. **(B) Scope and Purpose**

The purpose of this process is to create a "Contract Workspace" and add the 'Main Contract Document' and "CLID" to it for review, approval, and publishing.

ii. **(B) Process Flow and Key Tasks**

Create "Contract Workspace" → Select the 'Contract Domain' → Select the 'Hierarchical Type' → Select the 'Term Type' → Assign "Team Members" → Add/update "Contract Folder" documents → Review "Contract Folder" documents

*Figure 2.4.5 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Initiate and Review Contract*

1) **Create "Contract Workspace"**
   A "Contract Workspace" can be created in following ways:

   a. **From "Sourcing Project" (Post "Awards Scenario" approval)**
      This is the preferred method for creating a "Contract Workspace" that is linked to a "Sourcing Project". Once the "Awards Scenario" is approved, the "Project Owner" of the "Sourcing Project" creates a "Contract Workspace", completes the "Overview Form" to create the "Contract Workspace". In this case, the "Project Owner" of the "Sourcing Project" marks the assigned **Contracting Specialist/Lead** as the "Project Owner" of the "Contract Workspace".

      Depending upon the number of winning **Suppliers**, multiple "Contract Workspaces" may be created against a "Sourcing Project". In this case, each "Contract Workspace" has the 'Main Contract Document' and "Contract Line Item Details (CLID)" specific to the **Supplier**.
      Below is an illustration of the same:

DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

b. **From "Sourcing Project" (during the creation of the Sourcing Event itself)**
   This method of creating a "Contract Workspace" is preferred when the "Project Owner" (or associated "Contract Manager") of the "Sourcing Project" believes that the review of the 'Main Contract Document' requires significant time and can be done alongside the "Sourcing Project" execution. Please refer to section 2.3.3.(IV)ii.2) for details.

c. **From the "SAP Ariba Dashboard"**
   The assigned **Contracting Specialist/Lead** creates a "Contract Workspace" from "SAP Ariba Dashboard" by selecting "Contract Workspace (Procurement)" from "SAP Ariba Dashboard" and completing the "Overview Form".

   The assigned **Contracting Specialist/Lead** provides UNSPSC Level 2 category is provided in the 'Commodity' field in the "Overview Form".

   The assigned **Contracting Specialist/Lead** may link the "Contract Workspace" to a previously executed "Contract Workspace" or "Sourcing Project" by selecting the 'Predecessor Project' field in the "Overview Form". This helps in indicating the relationship between projects in "SAP Ariba".

   In case, the "Contract Workspace" created is identical (or similar) to a previously executed "Contract Workspace", the assigned **Contracting Specialist/Lead** may use the 'Copy from Project' field to readily import (but not limited to) "Overview Form" details, and if required, "Project Groups" and documents from the previously executed project into the current project. This imported information is modifiable in the current "Contract Workspace".

   The assigned **Contracting Specialist/Lead** selects the 'Contract Domain', 'Hierarchical Type', and 'Term Type' while completing the "Overview Form" as explained below.

*Important Note: "Contract Workspace" cannot be created against Suppliers with "Disqualified" status in the Supplier Master Database, maintained by the DGS.*

2) Select the 'Contract Domain'
   The contract can be a Goods contract, Services contract, or a Capital Projects contract.

3) Select the 'Hierarchical Type'
   Contract hierarchies are used to organize and view related contracts, to combine pricing terms across selected contracts, and to roll up accumulated spend amounts throughout the hierarchy.

   The "CLM module" enables the "Project Owner" to organize contracts into hierarchies where a master agreement (also known as framework agreement) is the parent to one or more sub-agreements (also known as call-off contract). The stand-alone agreement is a contract that is not part a contract hierarchy and is executed by the Entity for its own requirements. Below is an illustrative example of contract hierarchy:

</tr>
</table>

**Figure 2.4.7: Master Agreement – Sub-agreement Hierarchy type**

As illustrated above, multiple sub agreements may roll up to a master agreement. The Entity/department executing the sub-agreement raises the Purchase Orders (PO) against the same.

*Important Note: The Entity/department executing the sub-agreement owns the management of the sub-agreement. The Entity/department can make necessary amendments or manage any Claim/Penalty/Dispute for the sub-agreement.*

Depending upon the type of agreement, suitable 'Hierarchical Type' is selected in the "Overview Form". If the sub-agreement is selected as the 'Hierarchical Type', the "Project Owner" must provide a master agreement reference in the "Overview Form".

*Important Note: Master agreement and sub-agreements are managed via different "Contract Workspaces" in "SAP Ariba".*

4) Select the 'Term Type'
   The following are 'Term Type' available in a "Contract Workspace":

   a. **Fixed** - A fixed-term contract is a contractual relationship between a **Supplier** and an Entity/GPO that lasts for a specified period.

   b. **Auto-Renew** – Auto-Renew contracts may automatically extend past the expiration date. When using Auto-Renew, the "Project Owner" specifies renewal interval and the maximum number of renewals.

DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

The "Contract Workspace" gets activated when the "Overview form" is completed and submitted by the assigned *Contracting Specialist/Lead*. This *Contracting Specialist/Lead* becomes the "Project Owner" of the project.

5) Assign "Team Members"
   The "Team Members" are grouped into:

   a. **"Project Groups"**
      The "Project Groups" enabled within the "CLM module" are:

      a1. **Project Owner**
          The "Project Owner" is responsible for execution of "Contract Workspace" tasks.

      a2. **Procurement Manager**
          *Procurement Manager* is responsible for providing oversight of the CLM processes and ensuring execution is compliant with the Procurement Standards and other relevant regulations.

      a3. **Contract Administrator**
          *The Contract Administrator* is responsible for the execution of the contract. The *Contract Administrator* reviews the "Contract Folder", contract claim/penalty/dispute, and initiates contract amendments.

      a4. **Supplier**
          A *Supplier* is an individual or an organization that provides required goods/services/projects. In the "Contract Workspace", the *Supplier* is responsible for reviewing the "Contract Folder", executing the contract, and acknowledging termination notice and claim/penalty/dispute.

      a5. **Budget Owner**
          The *Budget Owner* is accountable for spending decisions of the section/department managing the contract. In the "Contract Workspace", the *Budget Owner* is one of the approvers for the documents provided in the "Contract Folder" before their execution.

      a6. **Legal**
          The assigned member from the *Legal* is added to the "Contract Workspace" to review the contract, contract amendments, and contract claim/penalty/dispute.

      a7. **Finance**
          The assigned member from the *Finance* is added to the "Contract Workspace" to review the contract, contract amendments, and contract claim/penalty/dispute.

      a8. **Master Data Management**

89
Procurement Manual (SAP Ariba Aligned)


---



دائرة الإسناد الحكومي
DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

The assigned member from the *Master Data Management* is added to the "Contract Workspace" to review the contract, contract amendments, and contract claim/penalty/dispute.

a9. **"Project Observers"**
"Project Observers" are responsible for only observing the progress of the "Sourcing Project". Participants of this group are pre-determined. The "Project Owner" can add members to this group but cannot modify the existing members.

b. **"System Groups"**
"System Groups" are groups of participants pre-determined for a "Contract Workspace" (e.g., "Approvers" and "Reviewers"). The "Project Owner" can add members to the "System Groups" but cannot modify the existing members.

## 6) Add/update "Contract Folder" documents

The "Documents" tab of the "Contract Workspace" contains a "Contract Folder". The "Contract Folder" is the key document folder that is shared with the "Reviewers" and "Approvers" at every stage. It may contain the following documents, depending upon the nature of the contract:

a. **'Main Contract Document'**
The 'Main Contract Document' is the legal document that defines the basis of the contract, including both parties' roles, responsibilities, and a detailed description of the work. The 'Main Contract Document' could be the master agreement, sub-agreement or stand-alone agreement. The "Project Owner" may use the 'Main Contract Document' templates provided in "SAP Ariba Contracting Library" or other approved template covering the required elements.

*Important Note: The 'Main Contract Document' may include the provision for a Performance Bond for the Supplier. Please refer to section 1.5 to review the exceptions to the Performance Bond.*

b. **"Contract Line Item Details (CLID)"**
The line items associated with the contract are created and managed in the "Contract Workspace" as "Contract Line Item Details (CLID)". These may include information regarding (but not limited to) specifications, unit of measure (UOM) and prices.

In case the "Contract Workspace" is linked to a "Sourcing Project", the "Project Owner" imports the "CLID" from the "Sourcing Project" directly. In case the "Contract Workspace" is not linked to a "Sourcing Project", the "Project Owner" creates "CLID" within the "Contract Workspace" in the following ways:

b1. Create "CLID" directly in "SAP Ariba".
b2. Download, complete, and upload the "CLID" excel template.

c. 'Termination Notice'
   The 'Termination Notice' is a legal notice to the Supplier confirming the termination of a contract. The 'Termination Notice' should always be prepared in collaboration with the Legal. This document is available in "Contract Folder" tab once the 'Termination' amendment is triggered.

d. 'Contract Claim/Penalty/Dispute Logging Form'
   The 'Contract Claim/Penalty/Dispute Logging Form' provides details of the raised claim/penalty/dispute. This document is available in "Contract Folder" tab once the contract claim/penalty/dispute tasks are triggered.

*Important Note: To publish a contract in the "Contract Workspace", the "Project Owner" must upload the 'Main Contract Document' and "CLID", for review and approval. The "Project Owner" may upload additional reference documents in the "Contract Folder", if required.*

7) Review "Contract Folder" documents
   All "Review" tasks are performed uniformly across the "Contract Workspace". Below are the key activities for any "Review" task:
   a. Step 1 - The "Project Owner" initiates a "Review" task by providing a 'Due Date' to the "Reviewer".
   b. Step 2 - The "Reviewer" opens the "Contract Folder", and downloads and reviews all required documents.
   c. Step 3 – The "Reviewer" uploads the modified "Contract Folder" documents (only in case of modifications) and clicks on "Complete Review" with additional comments/attachments if required.
   d. Step 4 - The "Project Owner" reviews the updated documents in the "Contract Folder". In case of modifications, the "Project Owner" may "Accept All changes" or initiate another round of review. The latest version of the documents gets saved in the "Contract Folder" (automatically) when the "Project Owner" clicks on "Accept All changes".
   e. Step 5 - The "Project Owner" marks the specific "Review" task "Complete" and initiates the next task.

In the "CLM module", review by the Contract Administrator, the "Supervisor" (Contracting Lead or Procurement Manager), and the Supplier are mandatory. The review with the Supplier is managed through a "Negotiation" task, where the Supplier can either "Accept Proposal" or "Propose Counter Proposal" and attach modified documents.

</table>

*Figure 2.4.9 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Approve and Publish Contract*

1) **Obtain approvals for "Contract Folder" documents**

All "Approval" tasks are performed uniformly across the "Contract Workspace". Below are the key activities for any "Approval" task:

a. **Step 1** - The "Project Owner" initiates an approval by providing a 'Due Date'.

b. **Step 2** - The "Approver" opens the "Contract Folder", and downloads and reviews all required documents.

c. **Step 3** - The "Approver" approves/denies the documents and provides comments/ attaches modified documents within the "Approval" task.

d. **Step 4** – In case the "Approver" has denied the documents (with recommended changes/justification), the "Project Owner" makes necessary changes and saves an updated version of documents in the "Contract Folder".

e. **Step 5** – If the "Project Owner" believes that the modified documents require review by "Reviewers", the "Project Owner" re-triggers specific "Review" tasks.

f. **Step 6** – In case the review by the "Reviewers" is not required, the "Project Owner" re-triggers the "Approval" task.

g. **Step 7** - If the "Approver" approves the documents, the "Contract Folder" moves to the next "Approver" in the chain automatically, and Step 2 – Step 6 are repeated.

h. **Step 8** – Once all approvals are completed, the status of the "Approval" task changes to "Completed", automatically.

*Important Note: Each "Review" tasks is specific to a "Reviewer", whereas an "Approval" task is a single task with a chain of "Approver"' designated as per the PDoA.*

2) **Obtain contract signatures**

The "Project Owner" obtains signatures on two hard copies of the 'Main Contract Document' from authorized signatories, starting with the **Supplier**. Obtaining signatures is an offline process. The "Project Owner" uploads a scanned copy of the signed 'Main Contract Document' in the "Contract Folder" and marks the task "Complete".

One hard copy is shared with the **Supplier** while the other hard copy is retained by the **Procurement** after the contract is "Published" in "SAP Ariba".

3) Create "Supplier Performance Management (SPM) Project" (optional task)
   As illustrated in *Figure 2.4.1*, the "CLM module" interacts with the "Supplier Performance Management module" to monitor supplier performance against the respective contract. The "Project Owner" creates a "Supplier Performance Management (SPM) Project" against the "Contract Workspace," as explained in *section 2.5.3.(III)ii.1)*.

4) Publish contract
   The "Project Owner" can publish a contract through the "Overview" tab of the "Contract Workspace". Upon completing this activity, the "Project Owner" confirms that the status of the contract is "Published". Only a "Published" contract can be used for the Requisition to Pay (R2P) processes.

## 2.4.3.(III)Initiate Contract Amendment

i. **(B) Scope and Purpose**

The contract amendment allows to make modifications to the existing contract, which have been approved and agreed with the *Supplier*. An amendment may be an addition, deletion, or modification to the existing contract. The original contract remains in place, along with changes made via the amendment.

In the "Contract Workspace", the following types of contract amendments are feasible:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>'Administrative'</th>
<th>'Amendment'</th>
<th>'Renewal / Extension'</th>
<th>'Termination'</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
• Changes that do not affect or alter the rights of the Entity / <em>Supplier</em><br>
• No financial / material impact<br>
• Include (not limited to):<br>
  ✓ Change in "Team Members"<br>
  ✓ Changes in billing instruction or address<br>
  ✓ Correction of typographical errors<br>
  ✓ Other changes permitted by the contract clause
</td>
<td>
• Changes into the contract by adding, removing, or changing the obligations or benefits<br>
• May include Change Orders, Change Requests, scope modification etc.<br>
• Claims / Penalties / Disputes are considered as a type of an 'Amendment' in "SAP Ariba"<br>
• Price update is also done through 'Amendment'
</td>
<td>
• Requested by End-Users or initiated by the <em>Procurement</em> on behalf of the <em>End-User</em><br>
• Renewals permitted only if relevant provision allowing for renewal exists in the contract<br>
• <em>Procurement</em> to verify that sufficient approved budget is available for 'Renewal/ Extension'
</td>
<td>
<strong>For convenience</strong><br>
• To protect the Entity's interest<br>
• Notify <em>Supplier</em> of extent, reason, effective date<br>
<strong>For default</strong><br>
• Continuous unsatisfactory performance; failure of <em>Suppliers</em> to mobilize within timeframe; breach of the provisions of the contract<br>
• Give <em>Supplier</em> a grace period to rectify performance
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No amendment tasks</td>
<td colspan="3">Respective amendment tasks in SAP Ariba</td>

</tbody>
</table>

*Figure 2.4.11 Contract amendments in "Contract Workspace."*

The 'Administrative' amendments do not have associated "Review" and "Approval" tasks. The "Project Owner" can directly make 'Administrative' amendments and publish without any review or approvals. On the other hand, selecting 'Amendment', 'Renewal/Extension', or 'Termination' type of amendments creates pre-defined "To Do", "Review", and "Approval" tasks in the "Contract Workspace", which are referred to as amendment tasks.

*Important Note: The "Project Owner" executes modification to the unit price, UOM, or the quantity of the "CLID" through 'Amendment' type of amendment in "SAP Ariba".*

The purpose of this process is to initiate various types of amendment to the contract, as required.

*Figure 2.4.12 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Initiate Contract Amendment*

1) **Receive and validate amendment (offline process)**
   An amendment request is raised either by the **Supplier** or the **Contract Administrator**. In either case, the **Contract Administrator** confirms the validity of the amendment before the "Project Owner" initiates respective tasks in "Contract Workspace". The **Contract Administrator** reviews the amendment with the **Budget Owner** to ensure the necessary budget is available for the proposed amendment. This validation of the amendment is managed outside "SAP Ariba".

   If the amendment is invalid, it is communicated to respective stakeholders, and any relevant query is resolved. In case the amendment is valid, and the budget availability is confirmed, the **Contract Administrator** communicates the details of the amendment and asks the "Project Owner" to initiate the amendment tasks.

2) **Initiate contract amendment**
   The "Project Owner" initiates an amendment through the "Overview" tab and selects the suitable amendment type. Following are the types of the contract amendments enabled in "SAP Ariba":
   a. 'Administrative' amendment
   b. 'Amendment' amendment
   c. 'Renewal/Extension' amendment
   d. 'Termination' amendment

3) **Edit information and complete amendment**
   In case of 'Administrative' amendment, the "Project Owner" can modify the "Overview" information and the "Team Member" and publish the contract directly through the "Overview" tab, without any reviews or approvals.

4) **Review 'Termination Checklist'**
   In case of 'Termination' amendment, the "Project Owner" reviews and completes the "Termination Checklist" first. The "Project Owner" may use the checklist provided in "Contract Workspace" or other approved template covering the required elements.

> **Important Note:** The "Termination Checklist" ensures that the termination is justified. It does not address relevant activities to be completed to close contract. These activities are provided in the 'Contract Closure Checklist' and are explained in **section 2.4.3.(VIII)ii.2)**

5) Add/update documents in the "Contract Folder"
   
   a. **In case of 'Amendment' or 'Renewal/Extension'**
      
      a1. The "**Project Owner**", in consultation with the **Contract Administrator**, may either create an additional amendment document or modify original contract documents, and upload them in the "Contract Folder".
      
      a2. The "**Project Owner**" may upload supporting document(s) in the "Contract Folder", if required.
   
   b. **In case of 'Termination'**
      
      Upon review and completion of the "Termination Checklist", the "**Project Owner**" must upload the 'Termination Notice' document in the "Contract Folder", along with any supporting documents.

## 2.4.3.(V) Initiate Contract Claim/Penalty/Dispute

### i. (B) Scope and Purpose

In the "Contract Workspace", contract claim/penalty/dispute is initiated through 'Amendment' type of amendment and managed through pre-defined claim/penalty/dispute tasks.

*Important Note: Only one set of claim/penalty/dispute tasks is available for claim/penalty/dispute in a "Contract Workspace". In case multiple claims/penalties/disputes arise during the contract lifecycle, they are managed by re-initiating the already completed "Claim/Penalty/Dispute tasks".*

The purpose of this process is to initiate a claim/penalty/dispute against the contract.

### ii. (B) Process Flow and Key Tasks

<table>
<tr>
<td>Raise/validate contract claim/penalty/dispute<br>(Contract Administrator)</td>
<td>→</td>
<td>Initiate contract claim/penalty/dispute tasks</td>
<td>→</td>
<td>Fill and submit 'Claim/Penalty/Dispute Logging Form'</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Figure 2.4.16 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Initiate Contract Claim/Penalty/Dispute**

1) **Raise/validate contract claim/penalty/dispute**
   A contract claim/penalty/dispute is raised by either the **Supplier** or the **Contract Administrator**. In either case, the **Contract Administrator** confirms the validity of the claim/penalty/dispute. The **Contract Administrator** reviews the claim/penalty/dispute along with the **Budget Owner** of the contract to ensure necessary budget availability (in case the claim/penalty/dispute is proposed by the **Supplier**).

   If the claim/penalty/dispute is invalid, it is communicated to the respective stakeholders, and any relevant query is resolved. In case the claim/penalty/dispute is valid, the **Contract Administrator** communicates the details of the claim/penalty/dispute and asks the "Project Owner" to initiate the claim/penalty/dispute tasks. This validation of the claim/penalty/dispute is managed outside "SAP Ariba".

2) **Initiate contract claim/penalty/dispute tasks**
   To initiate the claim/penalty/dispute tasks, the "Project Owner" selects the 'Amendment' type of amendment, responds "Yes" to the claim/penalty/dispute template question.

3) **Fill and submit 'Claim/Penalty/Dispute Logging Form'**
   The "Project Owner" downloads the 'Contract Claim/Penalty/Dispute Logging Form' document from the "Documents" tab of the "Contract Workspace" and sends it to the **Contract Administrator**.

101

### i. **(B) Scope and Purpose**

The purpose of this process is to close or terminate the contract, as required. A "Contract Workspace" may be closed in the following scenarios:
1) All contractual obligations are met.
2) The 'Expiration Date' has passed, and the contract is "Expired".
3) The contract is being 'Terminated' (either for convenience or for default).

This process covers all three scenarios and associated activities.

DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

1) Monitor "Contract Workspace" for closure/expiry
   The "Project Owner" in collaboration with **Contract Administrator** monitors the following for an open contract:
   a. **Supplier** performance against the contract through "SPM Project"
   b. Status of contractual obligations to estimate the contract closure
   c. Upcoming contract expiry

   In case the 'Expiration Date' of the contract approaches (before all contractual obligations are met), the "Project Owner" may extend the 'Expiration Date' to allow the **Supplier** to meet all contractual obligations, provided such an extension is requested by **Contract Administrator** and has been duly approved. If relevant provisions exist in the contract, the "Project Owner" may renew the contract after obtaining required approvals.

   The process for 'Extension/Renewal' amendment is explained in *section 2.4.3.(IV)*.

   In case the contract is not to be renewed or extended, either the "Project Owner" closes the "Contract Workspace", or the "Contract Workspace" automatically expires as per the initially set 'Expiration Date' (irrespective of the incomplete contractual obligations).

2) Complete 'Contract Closure Checklist'
   The 'Contract Closure Checklist' contains a comprehensive list of activities to be completed before the contract is expired or closed. The "Project Owner" can download the 'Contract Closure Checklist' document from the "Documents" tab of the "Contract Workspace". The "Project Owner" completes and uploads the 'Contract Closure Checklist' in the "Contract Folder" along with any relevant documents.

3) Edit 'Expiration Date', if required
   In case of 'Termination' amendment or contract early closure, the "Project Owner" proceeds to modify the contract 'Expiration Date' and close the "Contract Workspace" as required.

> *Important Note: There are no "Reviews" and "Approval" tasks for contract closure and expiry. The "Reviews" and "Approval" tasks for 'Termination' amendment are already covered in **Section 2.4.3.(IV)**.*

4) Communicate contract closure to stakeholders (offline process)
   The "Project Owner" completes the following activities post-closure or 'Termination' of the "Contract Workspace", outside "SAP Ariba":
   a. Coordinate with the **Finance** for release of the Performance Bond or retentions (as applicable).
   b. Communicate the contract closure to all relevant stakeholders.

## 2.5.2 "SAP Ariba Modules" Overview

The SPRM processes are grouped into three distinct stages, enabled either through an "SAP Ariba module" or managed offline. Below is an illustration of these stages and respective "SAP Ariba modules" enabling them:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>SPRM Stages</th>
<th>Segment Suppliers</th>
<th>Manage Supplier Relationship</th>
<th>Manage Supplier Performance</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Enabled by</td>
<td>"SAP Ariba Knowledge Project (Supplier Segmentation)"</td>
<td>(Offline Process)</td>
<td>"SAP Ariba Supplier Performance Mgmt. (SPM) Module"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Business Processes</td>
<td>1. Segment Suppliers</td>
<td>2. Set Relationships with Selected Suppliers</td>
<td>3. Evaluate Supplier Performance<br>4. Monitor Supplier Performance</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

*Figure 2.5.2 SPRM processes and "SAP Ariba" stages*

**Segment Suppliers** is enabled through "SAP Ariba Knowledge Projects (Supplier Segmentation)". A "Knowledge Projects (Supplier Segmentation)" is created at the GPO level to categorize all *Suppliers* catering to Common Categories and at each Entity level to categorize all *Suppliers* catering to Entity-Specific Categories. An *SRM Specialist* is assigned as the "Project Owner" for "Knowledge Projects (Supplier Segmentation)".

**Manage Supplier Relationships** enables development of collaborative relationships with selected *Suppliers*. It is executed at the GPO level for *Suppliers* catering to Common Categories and at each Entity level for *Suppliers* catering to Entity-Specific Categories. This stage is executed entirely outside "SAP Ariba". An *SRM Specialist* may be assigned as the single point of contact (SPOC) to execute and manage process for shortlisted *Suppliers*.

The **Manage Supplier Performance** enables evaluation, monitoring, and management of the *Supplier* performance against open contracts. It is enabled through the "SAP Ariba Supplier Performance Management (SPM) Module". For a Common Category contract, the "SPM project" is created and managed by the GPO, and for an Entity-Specific Category contract, the "SPM project" is created and managed by the respective Entity. The *Contracting Specialist/Lead* assigned as the "Project Owner" of the original "Contract Workspace" should be assigned the "Project Owner" of the associated "SPM project".

## 2.5.3 Details of the Level 3 Processes

### 2.5.3.(I) Segment Suppliers

i. **(B) Scope and Purpose**

Segment **Suppliers** process is executed periodically, preferably once a year. The process of segmenting **Suppliers** into pre-defined groups (Strategic, Critical, Transactional, and Operational) enables the procurement to optimize and prioritize its efforts and focus on developing long-term relationships with the right **Suppliers**.

> *Important Note: While segmenting **Suppliers**, it is crucial to consider the contracted spend with each **Supplier** for the same period to maintain a fair comparison. **Suppliers** that do not have contracted spend for the period of review may not be considered for Segment **Suppliers** process.*

The purpose of this process is to conduct the "Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Survey" and prepare the 'Supplier Segmentation Report' in the "Knowledge Projects (Supplier Segmentation)".

ii. **(B) Process Flow and Key Tasks**

<table>
<tr>
<td>Create the "Knowledge Project (Supplier Segmentation)"</td>
<td>Assign Procurement Manager</td>
<td>Prepare and publish "Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Survey"</td>
<td>Respond to the "Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Survey" (Survey Participants)</td>
<td>Prepare 'Supplier Segmentation Report'</td>
<td>Obtain approvals of the 'Supplier Segmentation Report'</td>
<td>Implement the Supplier Segment Strategy</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Figure 2.5.3 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Segment Suppliers**

1) **Create the "Knowledge Project (Supplier Segmentation)"**
   
   The assigned **SRM Specialist** creates the "Knowledge Project (Supplier Segmentation)" by selecting the "Knowledge Projects" from "SAP Ariba Dashboard", completing the "Overview Form", and selecting the "Supplier Segmentation Template".
   
   The assigned **SRM Specialist** may link the "Knowledge Project (Supplier Segmentation)" to a previously executed "Knowledge Project (Supplier Segmentation)" by selecting the 'Predecessor Project' field in the "Overview Form". This helps in indicating the relationship between projects in "SAP Ariba".
   
   In case, the "Knowledge Project (Supplier Segmentation)" created is identical (or similar) to a previously executed "Knowledge Project (Supplier Segmentation)", the assigned **SRM Specialist** may use the 'Copy from Project' field to readily import (but not limited to) "Overview Form" details, and if required, "Project Groups" and documents from the previously executed project

into the current project. This imported information is modifiable in the current "Contract Workspace"

The "Knowledge Project (Supplier Segmentation)" gets activated when the "Overview Form" is completed and submitted by the assigned *SRM Specialist*. This *SRM Specialist* becomes the "Project Owner" of the project.

2) Assign Procurement Manager
   The "Project Owner" assigns the *Procurement Manager* in the "Teams" tab. The *Procurement Manager* is responsible for providing oversight of the Supplier Segmentation process and ensuring execution is compliant with the Procurement Standards and other relevant regulations.

3) Prepare and publish "Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Survey"
   The "Project Owner" creates the "Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Survey" by completing the following components:
   
   a. **Survey Rules**
      These rules define execution of the survey, such as:
      a1. **Timing Rules** – define time-related parameters of the survey (e.g., Planned Start date and duration).

   b. **Survey Participants**
      Category Managers of the Entity-Specific Categories or Common Categories participate in the respective "Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Survey".
      
      For the categories, where the Category Managers are not assigned, *Contract Administrators* or *End-Users* involved in the category procurement participate in the survey.

   c. **Survey Content**
      The "Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Survey" content includes a 'Supplier Segmentation - Category Specific' document, which needs to be filled by survey participants. Following is the structure of the document:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Tab Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1. Data Inputs</td>
<td>To provide scores for 'Business Impact and 'Supplier Risk/Complexity'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2. Supplier Segmentation Output</td>
<td>To segment the 'Category - Supplier' combination; (automated tab)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3. Final Supplier Segment</td>
<td>To provide overall segmentation of the Supplier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4. Scoring Guidelines</td>
<td>Reference tab; to provide 'Business Impact and 'Supplier Risk/Complexity' scores in the 'Data Inputs' tab</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5. Category Taxonomy</td>
<td>Reference tab; to fill level 2 category in the 'Data Inputs' tab</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

*Table 2.5.1 'Supplier Segmentation – Category Specific' document structure*

4) Respond to the "Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Survey"
   The Supplier Segmentation depends on two parameters:

113
Procurement Manual (SAP Ariba Aligned)

دائرة الإسناد الحكومي
DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT
[Government logo/emblem]

a. **Business Impact of the Supplier** implies how vital the *Supplier* is to business operations and future initiatives.

b. **Supplier Risk /Complexity** implies the dependence on the *Supplier* and ease of switching the *Supplier*, if required.

The detailed criteria to score a *Supplier* on these parameters are provided in the 'Scoring Guidelines' tab of the 'Supplier Segmentation - Category Specific' document. A higher score implies higher business impact/complexity of the *Supplier* being evaluated. Scores on these two parameters serve as the criteria for segmenting the *Supplier* into one of the following segments:

**b1. Strategic Supplier** - Strategic Suppliers are the *Suppliers* that show potential of innovation and collaboration. These *Suppliers* usually have a proven track record and are some of the highest spend *Suppliers*. An *SRM Specialist* is assigned to each Strategic Supplier to monitor and ensure execution of the Supplier Segment Strategy elements specified in

**b2.**

**b3.** Figure 2.5.5.

*Important Note: The Suppliers of Common Categories are considered as Strategic Suppliers by default, and GPO ensures execution of the Supplier Segment Strategy elements for these Suppliers.*

**b4. Critical Supplier** – Critical Suppliers are critical to everyday operations, and any failure by such a *Supplier* usually has a significant impact. An *SRM Specialist* is assigned to each Critical Supplier to monitor and ensure execution of the Supplier Segment Strategy elements specified in

**b5.**

**b6.** Figure 2.5.5.

**b7. Operational Supplier** – Operational Suppliers have contracted commitments that require operational tracking and delivery monitoring. Usually, such *Suppliers* are not considered for development and collaboration initiatives or Supplier Risk Profiling process.

In case an Operational Supplier is in top 80% of the Entity spend, an *SRM Specialist* is assigned to such a *Supplier* to monitor and ensure execution of the Supplier Segment Strategy elements specified in

Figure 2.5.5.

114
Procurement Manual (SAP Ariba Aligned)


---



DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

Only in such a case, the Operational Supplier may be considered for development and collaboration initiatives or Supplier Risk Profiling process.

**b8. Transactional Supplier** – Transactional Suppliers are the *Suppliers* with minimal contracted spend and least impact.

In case a Transactional Supplier is in top 80% of the Entity spend, an *SRM Specialist* is assigned to such a *Supplier* to monitor and ensure execution of the Supplier Segment Strategy elements specified in

Figure 2.5.5. Only in such a case, the Transactional Supplier may be considered for development and collaboration initiatives.

*Suppliers* are segmented at the category level as well as overall Entity/GPO level. The following is a Supplier Segmentation Matrix:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Supplier Risk / Complexity</th>
<th colspan="4">Business Impact</th>

*Figure 2.5.4 Supplier Segmentation Matrix*

The "Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Survey" is completed as follows:

a. **For categories with Category Managers**
   The 'Supplier Segmentation – Category Specific' document is filled for each category by the respective Category Manager. The Category Manager identifies and scores each *Supplier*, on the above-explained parameters, within the category in the 'Data Input' tab of the document.

   The Category Manager may share this document with the relevant *Contract Administrators/End-Users* to collate required inputs. The collation of these inputs is

115
Procurement Manual (SAP Ariba Aligned)


---

DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

managed entirely outside "SAP Ariba". The Category Manager collates the inputs into one 'Supplier Segmentation – Category Specific' document, with information on all **Suppliers** for the respective category.

b. **For categories without Category Managers**
   The 'Supplier Segmentation – Category Specific' document is filled by the relevant **Contract Administrators/End-Users**.

The survey participants upload the completed 'Supplier Segmentation – Category Specific' document in the "SPM Project" as the survey response.

*Important Note: While collating data for their category, the Category Manager / Contract Administrator / End-User are advised to ensure that the entire contracted spend is accounted for in the 'Data Inputs' tab.*

5) **Prepare 'Supplier Segmentation Report'**
   The "Project Owner" downloads and collates the received survey responses in the 'Supplier Segmentation – Consolidated' document and modifies the 'Final Supplier Segment' tab. The "Project Owner" can download the 'Supplier Segmentation Consolidated' document from "Documents" tab.

*Important Note: The "Project Owner" is encouraged to validate the spend figures of the Suppliers during collation of survey responses and adjust them if required.*

This 'Supplier Segmentation – Consolidated' document when completed forms the 'Supplier Segmentation Report'. Only one 'Supplier Segmentation Report' and should include all **Suppliers**.

The key outcome of the 'Supplier Segmentation Report' is the Supplier Segmentation Matrix (illustrated in Figure 2.5.4) which provides a relative position of a **Supplier**.

*Important Note: All Common Category Suppliers are considered as Strategic Suppliers.*

6) **Obtain approval of the 'Supplier Segmentation Report'**
   "Project Owner" uploads the completed 'Supplier Segmentation Report' in "Documents" tab for approval by the "Approvers" designated as per the PDoA.

If "Approvers" reject the 'Supplier Segmentation Report', they must provide a valid justification to the "Project Owner". If "Approvers" recommend changes to the 'Supplier Segmentation Report', the "Project Owner" makes the recommended modifications and uploads the updated version of the 'Supplier Segmentation Report' in the "Knowledge Project (Supplier Segmentation)" for approval.

If the "Approvers" approve the 'Supplier Segmentation Report', the respective segment strategies are executed across **Suppliers**.

116

**Figure 2.5.9 Example – Supplier Performance Creation**

As illustrated above, in the "SAP Ariba Sourcing module", two "Sourcing Projects" are executed where Supplier A wins selected line items. In the "SAP Ariba CLM module", a "Contract Workspace" is created against each "Sourcing Project" with the 'Main Contract Document' and "CLID" specific to Supplier A.

An "SPM Project" is created against a "Contract Workspace", enabling the evaluation and management of Supplier performance against the associated contract. (e.g., in above illustration an "SPM Project" is created against each "Contract Workspaces").

A key outcome of the "SPM Project" is a 'Supplier Performance Scorecard', which summarizes how the Supplier is performing against the KPIs and goals established in the contract. (e.g., in above illustration, a 'Supplier Performance Scorecard' is created against each "SPM Project")

'Supplier Performance Scorecards' from all associated "SPM Projects" for the Supplier are consolidated, by "SAP Ariba", to provide an overall 'Supplier Performance Scorecard'. (e.g., in above illustration, 'Supplier Performance Scorecards' against the two "SPM Projects" merge into an overall 'Supplier Performance Scorecard' for Supplier A)

</table>

**Figure 2.5.10 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Evaluate Supplier Performance**

1) Create "SPM Project"
   The assigned *Contracting Specialist/Lead* creates an "SPM Project" either from within a "Contract Workspace" or by selecting the "Supplier Performance Management Project" from "SAP Ariba Dashboard" and completing the "Overview Form".

   The assigned *Contracting Specialist/Lead* may link the "SPM Project" to a previously executed "SPM Project" or "Contract Workspace" by selecting the 'Predecessor Project' field in the "Overview Form". This helps in indicating the relationship between projects in "SAP Ariba".

   In case, the "SPM Project" created is identical (or similar) to a previously executed "Contract Workspace", the assigned *Contracting Specialist/Lead* may use the 'Copy from Project' field to readily import (but not limited to) "Overview Form" details, and if required, "Project Groups" and documents from the previously executed project into the current project. This imported information is modifiable in the current "SPM Project".

   The "SPM Project" gets activated when the "Overview Form" is completed and submitted by the assigned *Contracting Specialist/Lead*. This *Contracting Specialist/Lead* becomes the "Project Owner" of the project.

2) Assign "Team Members"
   The "Team Members" are grouped into:

   a. "Project Groups"
      The "Project Groups" enabled within "SPM Project" are:

DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

a1. **Project Owner**
    The "Project Owner" is responsible for execution of "SPM Project" tasks.

a2. **SRM Specialist**
    *SRM Specialist* is responsible for reviewing and approving/denying the 'Supplier Performance Management Plan'.

a3. ***Contract Administrator***
    The assigned *Contract Administrator* in the original "Contract Workspace" should be assigned as the *Contract Administrator* for the associated "SPM Project". The *Contract Administrator* is one of the "Supplier Performance Survey" participants and an "Approver" of the 'Supplier Performance Management Plan'.

b. **"System Groups"**
   "System Groups" are groups of participants pre-determined for an "SPM Project" (e.g., "Approvers" and "Reviewers"). The "Project Owner" can add members to the "System Groups" but cannot modify the existing members.

3) **Set up "Supplier Performance Input Collection Survey" and 'Supplier Performance Scorecard'**
   The "Project Owner" sets up the 'Supplier Performance Scorecard' by assigning weightage/target grade to each KPI.

   The "Project Owner" sets up the "Supplier Performance Input Collection Survey" by completing the following segments:

   a. **Survey Rules**
      This segment specifies the rules for the execution of the survey, such as:

**Figure 2.5.11 Supplier Performance KPIs and default survey questions**

These six KPIs are fixed for all "SPM Projects" and should not be deleted from any survey. The "Project Owner" may change the weightage of any KPI to '0' if the KPI is not applicable, but the KPI should not be removed from the survey and the scorecard. Similarly, no new KPI should be added to the survey and scorecard.

Based on the contract, against which the **Supplier** performance is being assessed, the "Project Owner" may change:
a. Weightage/target grade of KPIs
b. Questions within each KPI

4) Communicate performance goals to the Supplier
   The KPIs, criteria within each KPI, and frequency of performance evaluations are communicated to the **Supplier** outside "SAP Ariba". The "Project Owner" marks the task "Completed" after communicating with the **Supplier**.

5) Execute "Supplier Performance Input Collection Survey"
   The "Supplier Performance Input Collection Survey" gets automatically published as per the recurrence set by the "Project Owner" while completing the "Overview Form". The "Project Owner" is intimated about the upcoming survey to make any required changes to the survey rules, content, and participants, for the upcoming evaluation cycle.

125
Procurement Manual (SAP Ariba Aligned)

دائرة الإسناد الحكومي
DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

The survey participants must provide their responses against each question provided in the survey within "SAP Ariba".

## 6) Review and publish 'Supplier Performance Scorecard'

"SAP Ariba" generates the 'Supplier Performance Scorecard' based on the survey responses received, automatically. The 'Supplier Performance Scorecard' provides *Supplier* scores against each KPI and indicates the areas of improvement (KPIs where target grade is not met).

The "Project Owner" reviews and publishes the 'Supplier Performance Scorecard' for the other "Project Groups" members to view in "SAP Ariba" and shares it with the *Supplier* outside "SAP Ariba".

## 7) Develop 'Supplier Performance Management (SPM) Plan'

If the *Supplier* performs satisfactorily on all KPIs (met the target grade), the evaluation cycle may be considered closed, and the "Project Owner" repeats the entire process for the next evaluation cycle.

If the *Supplier* fails to perform satisfactorily against any of the KPIs, the "Project Owner" completes the 'Supplier Performance Management Plan' document to rectify the performance Below is the structure of the 'Supplier Performance Management Plan' document:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Tab Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1. Supplier Performance Management Plan</td>
<td>To identify root cause for low <em>Supplier</em> scores and develop a mitigation plan for the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2. Progress report</td>
<td>To track progress made on the high priority actions identified in the 'SPM Plan'.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

*Table 2.5.6 'Supplier Performance Management Plan' document structure*

The "Project Owner" downloads the 'SPM Plan' document from the "Documents" tab of the "SPM Project" and completes the 'Supplier Performance Management Plan' tab. The "Project Owner" may consider the following points while completing the 'SPM Plan' tab:

a. For each KPI (where *Supplier* performance is lacking), identify the root cause, potential impact, corrective actions, owner of the corrective action, completion date and ease of implementation.

b. Each row should refer to a unique 'Corrective action.'

The "Project Owner" reviews the completed 'SPM Plan', with the *Supplier*, to finalize and prioritize the corrective actions to be executed. Based on this review, the corrective actions may be modified, or additional actions may be identified. Relevant changes must be made to the 'Supplier Performance Management Plan' tab before uploading it in the "SPM Project" for review and approval.

126
Procurement Manual (SAP Ariba Aligned)

دائرة الإسناد الحكومي
DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

Only the 'SPM Plan' tab of the document is uploaded for review and approval. The 'Progress Report' tab is not uploaded at this point.

8) Obtain approvals for the 'SPM Plan'

The 'SPM Plan' is reviewed and approved by the "Approvers" designated *as per the PDoA*. "Approvers" may consider following points while reviewing the 'Supplier Performance Management Plan':

a. Each row of the 'SPM Plan' tab should refer to a unique corrective action.
b. The root cause analysis and identified impacts should be accurate and based on logical, objective criteria.
c. The corrective actions must address the root cause and mitigate the impact.
d. The target date for the corrective actions must be realistic.
e. The corrective actions must be aligned to the overall 'Category Strategy', 'Procurement Strategy', and the Supplier Segment Strategy.

The "Approvers" may suggest modifications to the plan, which the "Project Owner" makes and re-submits the plan for approval.

The "Project Owner" shares the approved 'SPM Plan' with relevant stakeholders for execution and monitoring outside "SAP Ariba".

```

*Figure 2.6.2 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Create and Approve PR*

1) **Complete and Submit PR**
   The *End-User* creates a PR to request goods/services/projects considering (but not limited to):

   a. Existing inventory & requirement forecast.
   b. Suitable category and sub-category.
   c. Technical specifications, scope, and time plan which may be required in the PR.
   d. Budget estimated and reserved for the PR
   e. In case the requirements in the PR exceed the allocated budget, the *End-User* either arranges for additional budget, in consultation with the *Budget Owner*, or modifies the requirements in the PR to fit the allocated budget.

*Important Note: A procurement requirement is not to be split into multiple PRs to bypass approval authorities.*

2) **Obtain approvals for the PR**
   PR is reviewed and approved by approvers designated *as per the PDoA*. These approvers are from the *Business*, the *Finance*, and the *Procurement*.

   The *Procurement* verifies, if the PR requirements can be met by existing stock/inventory. If available, the requested goods are issued from the stock/inventory and the PR is cancelled by the *End-User*. If not available, the PR is reviewed for other details.

   If the approvers suggest modifications to the PR, the *End-User* makes the recommended changes and re-submits the updated PR for approval.

   An approved PR leads directly to PO unless the source of supply or conditions of the purchase must first be determined, in which case the "Sourcing Request" is created by the *Procurement* for execution of Sourcing.

```

*Figure 2.6.4 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Create and Approve PO*

1) **Create PO**
   Multiple Purchase Requisitions (PR) may either be consolidated into aggregate PO or single PR may require multiple POs for the following reasons:
   a. **Same/Different Suppliers** – Goods/services/projects requested in the PR are procured through one or multiple **Suppliers**.
   b. **Same/Different Ship to Address** – Goods/services/projects requested in the PR are to be delivered across one or more locations.
   c. **Catalogue vs. Non-Catalogue** - Goods/services/projects requested in the PR may be partially fulfilled through an existing contract.

> *Important Note: An approved PR is not to be split into multiple POs to bypass approval authorities.*

A PR may be converted into a PO directly, through an existing contract, or through sourcing and contracting processes. PO is created by the **Procurement**.

> *Important Note: Approved PR is verified by the Procurement against existing contracts to identify if the requirement can be fulfilled without entering into new obligations.*

A Purchase Order (PO) includes details defining what the **Supplier** needs to fulfil the order. The PO serves as an electronic trace defining the purchase. The details relevant for the PO include (but not limited to):

a. Supplier details
b. Descriptions, quantities, prices, and discounts on goods/services/projects in the order
c. Payment terms along with shipment/delivery dates

2) **Obtain approval for the PO**
   PO is reviewed and approved by approvers designated **as per the PDoA**. If the approvers suggest modifications to the PO, the **Procurement** makes the recommended changes and re-submits the updated PO for approval. Approved PO is sent to the **Supplier** for delivery of goods/services/projects.

3) Issue PO to the Supplier

The *Supplier* confirms the receipt of the PO and specifies whether it can provide the entire quantities specified in the PO or not, as a part of this process.

In cases where a *Supplier* can only provide partial quantities, the *Procurement* can edit the PO for the quantities confirmed by the *Supplier*. The modified PO needs to go through the approval process explained above.

## 2.6.2.(III) Receive Goods/Services/Projects and Confirm

### i. (B) Scope and Purpose

The purpose of the receiving process is to accept the goods/services/projects, generate a receipt for the accepted delivery. The process includes quality inspection and management of return of goods to the *Suppliers*.

*Figure 2.6.6 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Receive Goods/Services/Projects and Confirm*

1) Receive goods/services/projects and match against PO
   The goods received by the *End-User* or the store/warehouse are reviewed to ensure that the quantity delivered and specifications match with the PO and the delivery documents.

   Based on the review, one of the following approaches may be taken:

   a. **Delivery Rejection**
      Delivery of goods may be rejected if the quantity or the specifications do not match with that provided in the PO. In such cases, the discrepancy is communicated to the *Procurement* and the *Supplier*. Depending on the reason for rejection, the *Supplier* either replaces the defective/damaged goods or delivers the missing goods.

      In case of services/projects, the *Supplier* is communicated of the deficiency of service against the PO (mapped against milestones, variance from the KPI's/SLA, timelines etc.).

      Delivery of goods/services/projects can be rejected completely or partially (e.g., % of goods delivered are not as per the specification in the PO). In case of partial rejection, partial Goods/Services/Projects Receipt is created against the PO.

      If required, the *Procurement* may also fulfil the pending requirement through an alternate *Supplier*.

b. **Delivery Acceptance**
   Delivery of goods is accepted if the quantity and specifications of goods received match with that provided in the PO. In case of services/projects, the *End-User* provide inputs on service/projects delivery with milestones, KPI's/SLA, timelines etc. which is used to provide delivery acceptance.

2) **Create and approve Goods/Service/Projects Receipt**
   *End-User* creates Goods/Service/Projects Receipt reflecting the goods/services/projects accepted upon delivery or post inspection. In case of goods/services/projects with high value, Entity may choose to form a committee to conduct the inspection.

   The Goods/Service/Projects Receipt is reviewed by the approvers designated *as per the PDoA*. In case the approvers suggest modifications to the Goods/Service/Projects Receipt, the *End-User* makes necessary modifications and re-submits it for approval.

   The Goods/Service/Projects Receipt and PO are used as reference documents for invoice reconciliation process and authorizing payment to the *Supplier*.

1) Create, submit and approve PR
   The *End-User* creates and submits the PR and justification for Emergency purchase for approvals by approvers designated *as per the PDoA*.

   If approvers reject the justification for the emergency purchase, the requested goods/services/projects must be procured through regular channels. If approvers recommend modifications to the justification, the *End-User* makes the recommended modifications and re-submits PR and justification for the emergency purchase for approval.

2) Create, submit and approve PO
   Approved PR is used by the *Procurement* to verify if the requirements can be met by existing stock/inventory. If available, the requested goods are issued from the stock/inventory. If required goods are not available, the *Procurement* creates the PO and submits it for approvals by approvers designated *as per the PDoA*.

   If approvers recommend modifications to the PO, the *Procurement* makes the recommended modifications and re-submits it for approval.

3) Receive goods/services/projects
   *Procurement* engages with the *Supplier* and procures the required goods/services/projects. *Supplier* provides an invoice of the purchase to the *End-User*.

## 2.7 Risk and Regulation (R&R)

### 2.7.1 Overview

The Risk and Regulation (R&R) process group consists of procedures for the management of procurement risks and regulatory changes.

This section explains the activities, decisions involved, documents and templates used, the outcomes, and the stakeholders involved in the R&R processes.

*Procurement* risk is defined as a potential for failure of any of the procurement processes. Procurement risks may be associated with *Supplier*, supply chain, and procurement organization as illustrated below:

```

**Supplier Risk**: Risks emerging from *Suppliers'* end and are specific to *Supplier* (e.g., bankruptcies, location change, price increase, quality/delivery failure, mergers and acquisitions etc.)

**Supply Chain Risks**: Risks emerging from unexpected external market events (e.g., environmental disasters causing supply chain disruption, price and supply volatility, supply shock, etc.)

**Organizational Risks**: Risks emerging from internal processes/organization (e.g., incorrect approach to market, insufficient procurement resources, absence of category expertise, etc.)

## 2.7.2 "SAP Ariba module" Overview

All R&R procurement processes are enabled through the "SAP Ariba Knowledge Project (Supply Risk)". The R&R processes are clubbed into three distinct stages, each of which is enabled through a different risk profiling type (sub-template) within the "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk)" as illustrated below.

*Figure 2.7.3 R&R processes and "SAP Ariba" stages*

The **Profile Supplier Risk** is enabled through the "Supplier Risk Profiling" sub-template within the "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk)". A "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Supplier Risk Profiling" is created at GPO level to profile **Suppliers** catering to Common Categories, and at each Entity level to profile **Suppliers** catering to Entity-Specific Categories. If a **Supplier** caters to Entity-Specific Categories and Common Categories, then the **Supplier** is profiled both at GPO and Entity level. An **SRM Specialist** is assigned as the "Project Owner" for the "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Supplier Risk Profiling".

The **Manage Procurement Risk** is enabled through the "Mitigate Risk" sub-template within the "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk)". A "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Mitigate Risk" is created at Entity/GPO level to manage respective procurement risks. An **SRM Specialist** is assigned as the "Project Owner" for the "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Mitigate Risk".

The **Manage Regulation Change** is enabled via the "Regulation Change" sub-template within the "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk)". A "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) – Regulation Change" is only created at the GPO level. A **Risk and Regulations Lead** from the GPO is assigned as the "Project Owner" for the "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) - Regulation Change".

### 2.7.3 Details of the Level 3 Processes

#### 2.7.3.(I) Profile Supplier Risk

i. **(B) Scope and Purpose**

The Profile Supplier Risk process is conducted periodically, preferably once a year, to identify high-risk *Suppliers* and optimize the risk mitigation efforts. As per the Supplier Segment Strategy, the risk profiling is conducted for following *Suppliers*:

1) All Strategic and Critical *Suppliers*.
2) Operational *Suppliers* with spend in the top 80% of the Entity spend.

The purpose of this process is to conduct "Supplier Risk Profile Input Collection Survey" and develop risk profile for *Suppliers* in "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) – Supplier Risk Profiling".

**Figure 2.7.4 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Profile Supplier Risk**

1) Create "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) – Supplier Risk Profiling"
   
   The assigned *SRM Specialist* creates a "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) – Supplier Risk Profiling" by selecting "Knowledge Project" from the "SAP Ariba Dashboard", completing the "Overview Form", selecting the "Supply Risk Management" template, and selecting "Supplier Risk Profiling" as the risk profiling type.
   
   The assigned *SRM Specialist* may link the "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) – Supplier Risk Profiling" to a previously executed "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) – Supplier Risk Profiling" by selecting the 'Predecessor Project' field in the "Overview Form". This helps in indicating the relationship between projects in "SAP Ariba".
   
   In case, the "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) – Supplier Risk Profiling" created is identical (or similar) to a previously executed "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) – Supplier Risk Profiling", the assigned *SRM Specialist* may use the 'Copy from Project' field to readily import (but not limited to) "Overview Form" details, and if required, "Project Groups" and documents from the

previously executed project into the current project. This imported information is modifiable in the current "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) – Supplier Risk Profiling".

The "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) – Supplier Risk Profiling" gets activated upon completion and submission of the "Overview Form" by the assigned *SRM Specialist*. This *SRM Specialist* becomes the "Project Owner" of the project.

2) Prepare and publish "Supplier Risk Profile Input Collection Survey"
   The "Project Owner" sets up the "Supplier Risk Profile Input Collection Survey" by completing following segments:

   a. **Survey Rules**
      These rules define execution of the survey, such as:
      a1. **Timing Rules** – define time-related parameters of the survey (e.g., Planned Start date and duration).

   b. **Survey Participants**
      The Category Managers participate in the 'Supplier Risk Input Collection Survey'. For the categories, where the Category Managers are not assigned, the *Contract Administrators* and *End-Users* participate in the survey.

   c. **Survey Content**
      The content of the survey includes a 'Supplier Risk Profiling' document, which is filled by all survey participants. Following is the structure of the document:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Tab Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Supplier Risk Profile</td>
<td>To obtain details regarding <em>Supplier</em> risk profiles from survey participants and identify high-risk <em>Suppliers</em>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Risk Profiling Criteria</td>
<td>Reference tab; provides detailed criteria to score the <em>Supplier</em> on Financial, Operational, Environmental, and Legislative Impacts in 'Supplier Risk Profiles' tab.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Category Taxonomy</td>
<td>Reference tab; to add level 2 category details in 'Supplier Risk Profiles' tab.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**Table 2.7.1** 'Supplier Risk Profiling' document structure

3) Respond to "Supplier Risk Profile Input Collection Survey"
   The *Supplier* risk profile is determined by assessing following types of *Supplier* risks:

   a. **Financial Risk**
   b. **Operational Risk**
   c. **Environmental Risk**
   d. **Legislative Risk**

   The detailed evaluation criteria for these risks is provided in the 'Risk Profiling Criteria' tab of the 'Supplier Risk Profiling' document. A higher score implies higher associated risk.

149
Procurement Manual (SAP Ariba Aligned)

دائرة الإسناد الحكومي
DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

*Suppliers* are evaluated on above mentioned risk types on a five-point scale (0 – No risk, 1 – Low Risk, 2- Medium risk, 3 – High risk, and 4 – Significant risk). *Suppliers* with a score of 3 (or above) on any of the risk types are considered as high-risk *Suppliers*.

The "Supplier Risk Profile Input Collection Survey" is completed as follows:

a. **For categories managed by Category Managers**
   The 'Supplier Risk Profiling' document is filled for each category by the respective Category Manager. The Category Manager identifies and assesses the *Supplier* risk in the 'Supplier Risk Profiles' tab of the document.

   The Category Managers may share this document with the relevant *Contract Administrators* and *End-Users* to collate required inputs. The collation of these inputs is managed outside "SAP Ariba". In such cases, the Category Manager collates these inputs into one 'Supplier Risk Profiling' document.

b. **For Categories without Category Managers**
   The 'Supplier Risk Profiling' document is filled by the relevant *Contract Administrators* and *End-Users*.

The survey participants upload the completed 'Supplier Risk Profiling' document in the "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) – Supplier Risk Profiling" as the survey response.

*Important Note: While collating data for their category, the Category Manager / Contract Administrator / End-User are advised to ensure that the entire contracted spend is accounted for in the 'Supplier Risk Profiles' tab.*

4) **Complete 'Supplier Risk Profiling – Consolidated'**
   The "Project Owner" collates received survey responses in the 'Supplier Risk Profiles' tab of the 'Supplier Risk Profiling – Consolidated' document and completes the 'High-Risk Suppliers' tab of the document. The "Project Owner" can download the 'Supplier Risk Profiling – Consolidated' document from the "Documents" tab.

5) **Close "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) – Supplier Risk Profiling"**
   The "Project Owner" may close the "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) – Supplier Risk Profiling" from the "Overview" tab once the 'Supplier Risk Profiling – Consolidated' document has been uploaded in the "SAP Ariba" and shared with relevant stakeholders.

**Figure 2.7.6 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Identify and Assess Risk**

1) **Create "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) – Mitigate Risk"**
   The assigned **SRM Specialist** creates a "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) – Mitigate Risk" by selecting "Knowledge Project" from the "SAP Ariba Dashboard", completing the "Overview Form", selecting the "Supply Risk Management" template, and selecting the "Risk Mitigation" as the risk profiling type.

   The assigned **SRM Specialist** may link the "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) – Mitigate Risk" to a previously executed "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) – Mitigate Risk" or "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) – Supplier Risk Profiling" by selecting the 'Predecessor Project' field in the "Overview Form". This helps in indicating the relationship between projects in "SAP Ariba".

   In case, the "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) – Mitigate Risk" created is identical (or similar) to a previously executed "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) – Mitigate Risk", the assigned **SRM Specialist** may use the 'Copy from Project' field to readily import (but not limited to) "Overview Form" details, and if required, "Project Groups" and documents from the previously executed project into the current project. This imported information is modifiable in the current "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) – Mitigate Risk".

   The "Knowledge Project (Supply Risk) – Mitigate Risk" gets activated upon completion and submission of the "Overview Form" by the assigned **SRM Specialist**. This **SRM Specialist** becomes the "Project Owner" of the project.

2) **Assign Procurement Manager**
   The "Project Owner" assigns the **Procurement Manager** in the "Teams" tab. The **Procurement Manager** is responsible for providing oversight of the 'Identify and Assess Risk' processes and ensuring execution is compliant with the Procurement Standards and other relevant regulations.

3) **Prepare and publish "Risk Register Input Collection Survey"**
   The "Project Owner" sets up the "Risk Register Input Collection Survey" by completing the following components:
   
   a. **Survey Rules**
      These rules define execution of the survey, such as:

152

a1. **Timing Rules** – define time-related parameters of the survey (e.g., Planned Start date and duration).

b. **Survey Participants**
   Relevant Category Managers, *Sourcing Leads* and *Contracting Administrators* participate in the "Risk Register Input Collection Survey".

c. **Survey content**
   The survey content includes the 'Risk Identification, Assessment, and Mitigation' document, which is filled by all survey participants. Below is the structure of the document:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Tab Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1. Risk Identification</td>
<td><em>To capture the details regarding the risks - products & services impacted, type of risk, etc.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2. Risk Assessment</td>
<td><em>To identify and evaluate the impact of the risk (in terms of likelihood and severity)</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3. Risk Mitigation</td>
<td><em>To identify potential mitigation approaches and details for identified risks</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4. Risk Assessment Criteria</td>
<td><em>Reference tab: To provide the criteria for quantifying the likelihood and severity of different types of risks</em></td>

<tr>
<td>5. Risk Mitigation Approaches</td>
<td><em>Reference Tab: To provide different types of approaches which can be adopted to mitigate identified risks</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**Table 2.7.3** 'Risk Register and Mitigation Tracker' document structure

4) **Respond to "Risk Register Input Collection Survey"**
   All survey participants complete the following tabs of the 'Risk Identification, Assessment and Mitigation' document:

   a. **Risk Identification tab**
      The survey participants fill this tab with details such as risk title, description, and root cause for all existing/potential procurement risks.

   b. **Risk Assessment**
      Details from the 'Risk Identification' tab are auto imported into the 'Risk Assessment' tab. The survey participants assess the severity and likelihood of each risk in this tab. Detailed criteria for these parameters are provided in the 'Risk Assessment Criteria' tab of the document. A higher score implies higher severity and likelihood of the risk.

   c. **Risk Mitigation**
      Details from the 'Risk Assessment' tabs are auto imported into the 'Risk Mitigation' tab. The survey participants identify an appropriate mitigation approach for each risk in this tab. The types of mitigation approaches are detailed in the 'Risk Mitigation Approaches' tab of the document.

   If required, the survey participants may share the 'Risk Identification, Assessment, and Mitigation' document with the *End-Users* and *Sourcing Specialists*, for additional inputs. This

collation of inputs is managed outside "SAP Ariba". In this case, the survey participant collates these inputs into one 'Risk Identification, Assessment, and Mitigation' document and upload it as the survey response.

The survey participants remove duplicate risks and sanitize the information in the 'Risk Identification, Assessment and Mitigation' document before submitting it as survey response.

*Important Note: Survey participants should ensure that all potential risks for the high-risk Suppliers (identified in section 2.7.3.(I) are added to the 'Risk Identification, Assessment and Mitigation' document.*

5) Update 'Risk Register and Mitigation Tracker' document
   The "Project Owner" collates the received survey response into the 'Risk Register and Mitigation Tracker' document. Below is the structure of the document:

دائرة الإسناد الحكومي
DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

This section explains the activities, decisions involved, documents and templates used, the outcomes, and the stakeholders involved in the Supplier MDM processes.

*Important Note: This process is only applicable to procurement Suppliers.*

Below is an illustration of the Supplier MDM processes:

<table>
<tr>
<td>1. Initiate Supplier Registration Request</td>
<td>2. Register Supplier<br>3. Update Supplier Registration</td>
<td>4. Qualify/Disqualify Supplier<br>5. Identify Preferred Supplier</td>
<td>6. Deactivate Supplier<br>7. Reactivate Supplier</td>
</tr>
</table>

*Figure 2.8.1 Supplier MDM – Procurement Processes (Level 3)*

## 2.8.1.(I) Supplier Classification

The onboarding process of a Supplier varies with the type of Supplier. Suppliers can be broadly classified into the following two categories:

i. Abu Dhabi Suppliers (AD-DED)

This category includes Suppliers that operate in the Abu Dhabi & have a valid Abu Dhabi DED license.

ii. Non-Abu Dhabi Suppliers (Non-AD-DED)

This category includes Suppliers that do not have a valid Abu Dhabi DED license. Such Suppliers may further be classified into:

1) Local Suppliers (UAE Mainland and Freezone)
2) Foreign Suppliers

The Supplier Registration Team, at the Department of Government Support (DGS), is responsible for onboarding Suppliers and maintaining the Supplier Master Database.

## 2.8.3 Details of the Level 3 Processes

### 2.8.3.(I) Initiate Supplier Request

#### i. (B) Scope and Purpose

The *Supplier* onboarding process starts with a valid "Registration Request". The purpose of this process is to create, review, and approve the "Registration Request" and ensure that *Supplier* records are not duplicated in the Supplier Master Database.

#### ii. (B) Process Flow and Key Tasks

DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

a. *AD-DED Suppliers* raise a "Supplier Self-Registration Request" by opening the "SAP Ariba Supplier Self-Registration Request link" and completing and submitting the "Self-Registration Request form".

b. *Non- AD-DED Suppliers* request an Entity to raise an "Entity Raised Supplier Request", on their behalf. In such cases, the Entity user logs into "SAP Ariba Supplier Entity-Request Page", completes and submits the "Entity Raised Request Form", and uploads the required documents.

   The Entity user should validate the information provided by the *Supplier* before submitting the request and confirm that the business requirements which are met by the *Non - AD-DED Supplier* cannot be met by a *Supplier* that holds an Abu Dhabi DED license.

   The Entity user, while completing the "Entity-Raised Request Form" must confirm the expected spend with the *Supplier*. In case of *Foreign Suppliers*, this expected spend decides the attestation requirements.

2) Receive and assign "Registration Request"
   The *Supplier Registration Team Lead*, upon receiving on the "Registration Request", assigns the request to a *Supplier Data Management Specialist* for review and approval.

3) Review and approve/deny "Registration Request"
   The *Supplier Data Management Specialist* reviews the "Registration Request" for the following:

   a. Duplicate "Registration Request" - "SAP Ariba" automatically highlights if the received "Registration Request" is a duplicate and highlights potential matches using the following fields:
      a1. 'Company Name'
      a2. 'Commercial/Industrial License Number'
      a3. 'Tax Registration Number'

      In case "SAP Ariba" highlights potential matches for a "Registration Request", the *Supplier Data Management Specialist* checks for the following points, across potential duplicates:

   b. *Suppliers* with the same 'Company Name' appear as potential matches in "SAP Ariba". In this case, the *Supplier Data Management Specialist* should compare the 'Commercial/Industrial License Number' and 'Tax Registration Number' with that of the potential matches to determine if the "Registration Request" is a duplicate.

   c. *Suppliers* related to each other (e.g., parent and child companies) may have the same 'Tax Registration Number'. Such *Suppliers* appear as potential matches in "SAP Ariba". In such cases, the *Supplier Data Management Specialist* should compare the 'Commercial/Industrial License Number' with that of the potential matches to determine if the "Registration Request" is a duplicate.

دائرة الإسناد الحكومي
DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

*Important Note: Different 'Commercial/Industrial License Number' implies a different Supplier. A Supplier with multiple commercial/industrial licenses raises a separate "Registration Request" for each of the commercial/industrial license.*

Based on the above activities, the **Supplier Data Management Specialist** determines if the "Registration Request" is a duplicate and reject the same in such cases. In case "SAP Ariba" does not highlight a duplicate for a "Registration Request", the **Supplier Data Management Specialist** proceeds to further evaluation of the "Registration Request".

d. **Valid "Registration Request"** – In case the "Registration Request" is not a duplicate, the **Supplier Data Management Specialist** validates if the information provided in the "Registration Request" is accurate and matches the information in the documents provided.

In case the "Registration Request" is denied, the **Supplier Data Management Specialist** provides a valid rationale, and the **Supplier** or Entity may re-start the process.

If the details provided in the "Registration Request" are found accurate, the **Supplier Data Management Specialist** approves the request and assigns himself/herself as the "Supplier Manager" for the **Supplier**. The "Supplier Manager" acts as the single point of contact for the **Supplier** during the registration and qualification processes.

As soon as the "Registration Request" is "Approved", the **Supplier** receives an invitation to register with "SAP Ariba Network". This email includes the "SAP Ariba Registration Link".

*Important Note: In case the "Registration Request" is raised by the Entity, the Entity users is notified about the request status (approval/denied).*

Suitable communication channels are established to support **Suppliers** during the registration process. The **Supplier Registration Team** must only use these channels to communicate with the **Suppliers**. The channels set up are:

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<strong>SAP ARIBA<br>"Request Additional Info"<br>functionality</strong><br><br>
<em>Supplier Registration Team can communicate with the Supplier via "Request Additional info" functionality provided in "SAP Ariba" after Supplier has submitted the registration questionnaire</em>
</td>
<td>
<strong>Helpdesk<br>Email</strong><br><br>
<em>Supplier Registration team may also communicate with the Supplier using the helpdesk email:<br>srs@dgs.gov.ae</em>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

*Figure 2.8.5 "SAP ARIBA - Communication Channels"*

The "Request Additional Info" functionality is only active once the **Supplier** has created an "SAP Ariba Network Account". Hence it is not available during the Initiate Supplier Request process.

## 2.9 Item Master Data Management

### 2.9.1 Overview

Item Master Data Management (Item MDM) process group consists of procedures associated with the creation and maintenance of records of items representing unique goods/services. The Item Master Data provides accurate, consistent and complete record of goods/services procured across Entities. The responsibility for maintaining Item Master Data is centralized with changes to the records initiated by the Entities.

Following guidelines must be adhered to during creation and maintenance of the Item Master Database:

1) Records of Item Master Data are created for frequently purchased goods/services.
2) Each item is identified by a unique code in the Item Master Data.
3) The record of each item contains (but not limited to):
   a. Item Code
   b. Description
   c. Item type
   d. Item group
   e. Unit of Measurement
   f. Unit price.

182
Procurement Manual (SAP Ariba Aligned)

DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

4) Each item belongs to one of the UNSPSC Level 3 'Classes'. UNSPSC classification is explained in section 1.2.2.

5) Item Master Database is regularly cleansed to identify and remove duplicate records and rectify incomplete and inconsistent records, to ensure data integrity.

## 2.9.2 Details of the level 3 Processes

### 2.9.2.(I) Add/modify/Delete Item record

Entity requestor can raise a request to add/modify an item record in the Item Master Data though GPO Helpdesk. The raised request must be approved by the supervisor of the requestor. The Helpdesk forwards the request to the Item Master Data team.

The Item Master Data team reviews the raised request for completeness, accuracy, and duplication.

In case the request is duplicate, the Item Master Data team rejects the request and communicate the same to the GPO helpdesk. The GPO helpdesk communicates the same to the Entity requestor.

In case the request if inaccurate or incomplete, the Item Master Data team seeks additional information from the Entity requestor (through Helpdesk).

If case the request is accurate, complete, and valid, the Item Master Data team obtains required approvals as per the PDoA to create/modify/delete the record, depending upon the request. Once approved, the Item Master Data completes executes the request in the Item master Data and communicates the same to the GPO Helpdesk. The GPO Helpdesk communicates the completion of request to the Entity requestor.
