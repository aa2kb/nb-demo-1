### 1.1.2 Scope of the Procurement Manual
The Procurement Manual applies to all procurement activities conducted by the government Entities and the Government Procurement Office (GPO). The Executive Council (EC), or a relevant body authorised by the EC, may exclude an Entity from the application of the Procurement Manual. The Procurement Manual covers all relevant procurement processes and serves as the operational framework.

### 1.1.2.(I) List of Exemptions
The Procurement Manual does not apply to:

a) Staff salaries and benefits

b) Direct employment contracts or the engagement of individual experts which cannot be subject to tender

c) General and administration expenses for non-predefined technical specifications, electricity, water, utilities, accommodation rentals provided to the employees and governed by the housing policies, professional and non-professional bodies' subscriptions, fee paid to organisers of conferences/exhibitions

d) Agreements among government Entities or with international professional bodies for the purposes of research/collaboration/promotions

e) Sponsorships and grants

f) Purchase of artworks, artifacts, and associated ancillary expenses

g) Copyrights license fees except where there is a contractual obligation to purchase goods, services or projects

DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

## 1.1.3 Structure of the Manual

The structure of the Procurement Manual is aligned to the Procurement Capability Model (refer to Figure 1.3.1):

a) **Level 1** - Procurement capabilities are classified into Strategic, Tactical, Operational, and Support capabilities.

b) **Level 2** - Each procurement capability includes one or more procurement process group.

c) **Level 3** - Each procurement process group consists of procurement processes.

*Important Note: All procurement processes must be executed in line with the Procurement Standards.*

Procurement process groups are covered in the manual as per the following structure:

1. Overview
2. Details of level 3 Processes
   i. Scope and Purpose
   ii. Procedures and Methodologies
   iii. Roles and Responsibilities
3. Work Aids – Forms and Documents
4. RACI Matrix

Work Aids – Forms and Documents section is only provided where applicable. Best practice templates of these work aids are issued and maintained by the GPO. Entities may either use the templates provided by the GPO, or use another approved template covering required elements.

Procurement process maps, lists of tables and figures, and glossary of terms and definitions are covered in Appendix.

Procurement practitioners reading this manual should consider the following points:

a) Key roles and functions are covered in the Procurement Manual in ***bold Italic*** (e.g., *Sourcing Specialist*, *Tendering Committee*, *Contract Administrator* etc.).

b) Key business terms and keywords are covered in the Procurement Manual in Upper Case and defined in the Glossary (e.g., Negotiations Team, Common Category, Entity Specific Category, etc.).

c) Key documents are covered in the Procurement Manual in 'single quotes' (e.g., 'Supplier Segmentation Report', 'Sourcing Strategy', 'Category Strategy', etc.).

d) Supplier Master Data Management process group is executed entirely by Government Procurement Office (GPO) using "SAP Ariba". For this process group, key SAP Ariba terms, roles, statuses, templates, etc. are covered in the Procurement Manual in "double quotes" (e.g., "Supplier Manager", "General Registration Questionnaire" etc.).

e) Matters critical from a feasibility or compliance perspective are highlighted as *Important Note* (e.g., *Important Note: All Procurement processes must be executed in line with the Procurement Standards*).

f) Reference to other documents or sections within the Procurement Manual are highlighted as <ins>underlined italics</ins> (e.g., Please refer to <ins>*Section 2.5.3.(II)*</ins> for the details of the 'Supplier Development and Collaboration' processes).

## 1.2 Procurement Operating Model

The *Procurement* consists of the Government Procurement Office (GPO) and Entity *Procurement*. The Procurement Operating Model provides mandate, empowerment, and responsibilities of the Government Procurement Office (GPO) and Entity *Procurement*.

**Figure 1.2.1 Procurement Capability Model**

The Government Procurement Office (GPO) is established to fulfil the following objectives:

a) Acting on behalf of the Entities to consolidate demand for achieving economies of scale. The GPO is authorized to manage and execute sourcing for Common Categories.

b) Providing shared services such as Supplier Registration, Item Master Management, User Master Management, and Training.

c) Maintaining the Procurement Framework ensuring a standardized and efficient way of working of the *Procurement*.

d) Developing and operating the information technology platform for government procurement (eGate).

e) Running market development initiatives and managing partnerships with the private sector in coordination with the relevant authorities.

DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

Entity *Procurement* is responsible for procurement of the Entity-Specific Categories including sourcing, contracting, ordering, and managing *Supplier* performance. The Entity *Procurement* utilizes the shared services provided by the GPO.

The GPO engages stakeholders from the Entities and dedicated *Finance*, *Legal* or other resources as needed for procuring Common Categories. The Entity *Procurement* engages *End-Users* and dedicated *Finance*, *Legal* or other resources for procuring Entity-Specific Categories.

## 1.2.1 Category Classification

Classification of a category as a Common Category or an Entity-Specific Category depends on the category spend value and its commonality across Entities. A category that is procured by five or more Entities may be considered as a Common Category.

**Figure 1.2.2 Common vs. Entity Specific Categories**

## 1.2.2 Category Taxonomy

Category taxonomy refers to a hierarchical assignment of goods/services. In line with global best practices, UNSPSC (United Nations Standard Products and Services Code) taxonomy is recommended to be adopted by GPO and Entity *Procurement*. UNSPSC is a four-level taxonomy with each record represented with an eight-digit number and unique name, illustrated below:

**Figure 1.2.3 UNSPSC Categorizations**

The four primary levels of the UNSPSC are Segment, Family, Class, and Commodity. Each level is identified by two digits, that constitute together an overall eight-digit code.

Standard categorization of goods/services/projects may be used for:

a) Consolidation of demand requirements
b) Development of 'Category Strategy'
c) Segmentation of <em>Suppliers</em>, and
d) Identification of <em>Supplier</em> risk profiles.

Best practice templates provided for these processes already include UNSPSC taxonomy. All Abu Dhabi DED activities are mapped to Level 2 UNSPSC categories. A comprehensive 'DED-UNSPSC Mapping Report' is provided in <em>Section 2.2.3</em> for reference.

## 1.4 Procurement Benefits

This section provides the details regarding:

a) Definition of Baseline Spend and Procurement Benefits
b) General principles that apply to Baseline Spend and Procurement Benefits
c) Methodologies to calculate the Baseline Spend and Procurement Benefits

### 1.4.1 Definitions

1. **Baseline Spend**
   
   Baseline Spend is the foundation of the Procurement Benefits calculation. It is the value of addressable spend against which any benefit is measured. Establishing a baseline is the first step in the Procurement Benefits calculations process.

2. **Classification of Procurement Benefits**
   
   Procurement Benefits can be classified into Cost Reduction, Cost Avoidance, and Cash Impact. Details of the same are provided below:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Cost Reduction<br><i>'same for less'</i></th>
<th>Cost Avoidance<br><i>'avoiding future cost'</i></th>
<th>Cash Impact</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Definition</td>
<td>
• Benefits that directly reduce the cost base compared to the baseline<br>
• Costs can be one-offs or recurring/sustainable
</td>
<td>
• Cost was not included in the original baseline<br>
• Action taken now to avoid future incremental costs<br>
• Could include initiatives that lead to cost reduction in the future
</td>
<td>
• One - time impact of increased cash

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**Table 1.4.1 Procurement Benefits Classification**

## 1.4.2 General Principles

Following general principles apply to the calculation of Baseline Spend and Procurement Benefits:

1. **Baseline principles**
   i. An agreed baseline is required for Procurement Benefits calculations and must be signed-off by the relevant stakeholders from the *End-User*, the *Finance* and the *Procurement*.

   ii. Baseline could be historic actuals (e.g., prior year spend, budgeted spend, etc.).

   iii. The baseline must be supported by one or multiple data sets, such as Accounts Payable (AP) data, Purchase Orders (PO) data, Contracts data, etc.

   iv. An appropriate method to calculate the Baseline Spend should be determined for each type of procurement benefit.

2. **Procurement Benefits calculation principles**
   i. Procurement Benefits can be calculated after acceptance of a final, binding offer from one or more *Supplier(s)* and the acknowledgment of offer conditions (with written confirmation, Letter of Intent, contract amendment, etc.).

   ii. Benefits implementation costs (one-time investments) are excluded from the benefits calculation.

DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

## 1.4.3 Calculation Methodologies

### 1. Baseline Spend

Baseline Spend is based on two parameters and is calculated as following:

*Baseline Spend = Total Volume * Baseline Unit Price*

Total volume may be known or unknown. However, two methods can be used for calculations to estimate volume, as detailed:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Method</th>
<th>Situation</th>
<th>Method</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Demand Plan Forecast Volume</td>
<td>Forecast is known</td>
<td>• 100% of forecast volume for the specific spend area</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Historic forecast volume</td>
<td>Forecast is unknown</td>
<td>• 50% of historic volume + (50% of historic volume * category demand growth forecast %)<br>In general, previous year volumes are used as historic volumes; if this data is not available, the period that is used to calculate historic volume should be mentioned.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**Table 1.4.2 Volume Estimation Methodologies**

Baseline unit price may be estimated using one of the following methodologies:

i. Historic price baseline

Historic price baseline is relevant when the goods/services/projects were purchased previously (in last year). Below are the details of various methods to create a historic price baseline:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Price Method</th>
<th>Situation</th>
<th>Method</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Last Price Paid</td>
<td>Used where market is not volatile (applicable for components and traded items like office furniture, etc.).</td>
<td>• Last actual paid price in the Purchase Order (PO), or<br>• Contracted price, if last actual paid price is not available</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Average Price</td>
<td>Used in case of a volatile market (applicable for e.g., 100% index-based commodities)</td>
<td>• Average Price paid over the last year</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Average quoted Market Price</td>
<td>Used in case of a volatile market (Commodities for which transparent and independent index are not available)</td>
<td>• Average Price of historical offers after clarification from the <ins>Suppliers</ins></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**Table 1.4.3 Historic Baseline Price Calculation Methodologies**

ii. Comparable price baseline

If a certain goods/service has not been purchased previously, historic price baseline cannot be established. In such cases, the baseline price can be estimated using comparable goods/services/projects (identical or similar specifications) where the price is known. (e.g., estimating the baseline price for a car rental service by comparing it with similar services previously purchased by another Entity).

13
Procurement Manual (Business Processes)

دائرة الأسناد الحكومي
DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

iii. New price baseline
If neither a historic nor a comparable baseline can be established, a new baseline can be developed based on the initial RFI or RFP/RFQ responses provided by the **Suppliers**. The baseline price will be calculated as an average of the approved initial quotes. Any price reductions received through follow-on RFP/ auction/negotiation is considered as benefits.

## 2. Procurement Benefits

As illustrated in *Table 1.4.1*, Procurement Benefits are classified into three buckets:

### i. Cost Savings

Following are the various Cost Savings scenarios:

a. **Standard Method (last paid price – new price)**
   This method is used when the savings result from the difference between baseline and negotiated price. For example, when **Suppliers** are changed or when similar goods/services/projects are bundled, resulting in a better price per item. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

   *Savings = (baseline price – negotiated price) * volume*

b. **Free of charges Extra**
   These are the savings realized when contracts negotiated with **Suppliers** include 'extras' that have not been part of the goods/service offering of past purchases. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

   *Savings = Savings from free of charge 'extra' per unit * volume*

c. **Fluctuating market price with market Index**
   This method of calculation is used when the cost savings can be attributed to a changing market index that results in a better future price (with respect to the market price). This method is applicable for commodities (crude oil, metals, Agri-commodities, etc.) where prices are linked to indices and change frequently. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

   *Savings = Forecasted spend with historical index value – forecasted spend with new index value*

d. **Fluctuating market price without market Index**
   This method of calculation is used when there are no market price references available. There may be no good benchmarks to indicate the savings w.r.t the market. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

   *Savings = (Initial offer – negotiated offer) * expected volume*

14
Procurement Manual (Business Processes)

دائرة الدعم الحكومي
DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

e. **Volume Rebate**
   This method of calculation is used when the *Supplier* offers rebates on volume or similar incentives, which have not been included in previous purchases. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

   *Savings = (new rebate per unit – old rebate per unit) * volume*

f. **Re-engineered specification (substitution) / rationalization**
   For some goods/services/projects, the specification can be changed to reduce the price. New specifications examples may include (but not limited to) using black and white printers instead of coloured printers, using standard cars instead of high-end cars for rentals, and using standard event designs instead of specialized events. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

   *Savings = (Cost for original item/service – cost for substitute item/service) * volume*

g. **In-house vs. Outsourcing**
   For some categories, where services are provided in-house, outsourcing of services might be a viable option. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

   *Savings = (In-house cost (i.e. labor cost + material cost + overhead cost) – purchase price) x volume*

h. **Lease vs. Buy**
   For some categories lease of goods might be a viable alternative to buying (or vice versa). To compare the savings between leasing and buying options for goods, the cost per one unit needs to be calculated and compared. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

   *Savings = (Cost of purchasing per unit - leasing cost per unit) * volume*

i. **Reduced Cost of Disposal**
   At the end of their lifetime, some goods (e.g., Laptop) may be recycled. These costs need to be considered to determine the actual price of a product. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

   *Savings = Historic cost for disposal – new cost for disposal*

ii. **Cost Avoidance**
    Following are various Cost Avoidance scenario:

    a. **Demand reduction/yield improvement**
       This method of calculation is used when the volume of a defined goods/service has been reduced through active negotiations by *Procurement*, (i.e., demand control). Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

       *Savings = (Last volume – negotiated new volume) * last price*

15
Procurement Manual (Business Processes)


---



DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

b. **Reduced cost of service**
   This method is used to calculate the cost reductions for service (e.g., reduced maintenance cost through introduction of preventive measures). Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

   *Savings = (Historic service cost – new service cost)*

iii. Cash Impact
     Following are the various Cash Impact scenarios:

     a. **Inventory reduction**
        This method is used when the involvement of *Procurement* leads to a reduction of inventories (e.g., stock) and results in significant cost savings. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

        *Savings = (Old Inventory levels – New Inventory levels) x WACC*
        (WACC – Weighted Average Cost of Capital)

     b. **Payment term extension**
        This method is used when the involvement of *Procurement* results in a change of 'Payment Terms' and leads to a working capital improvement. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:

        *Savings = Working Capital Improvement = Average monthly invoice from supplier (VAT included) * New Payment terms (in days) / 30 * WACC*

        (VAT – Value added tax; WACC – Weighted Average Cost of Capital)

## 2. Procedures and Methodologies

### i. Conduct category analyses

a. To create a 'Category Strategy', the Category Manager conducts following category analyses:

#### a1. 'Internal Category Profile'

The 'Internal Category Profile' is developed by spend analysis and insights from supplementary documentation (supplier contracts, PO). It includes details such as (but not limited to) category description, annual spend and volume, **Supplier** base, top 10 **Suppliers** by spend, and spend by sub-category. Each detail provided in the 'Internal Category Profile' must be supported by relevant analysis.

#### a2. External Market Analysis

'External Market Analysis' includes details of the industry structure and **Supplier** market for the category. It includes details such as (but not limited to):

**I. Category Definition** – includes description of the category, its characteristics and other relevant information

**II. Value Chain** – includes graphical representation of activities/processes performed or undertaken to deliver the goods/services/projects

**III. Demand Drivers** – includes details regarding historic and expected demand, key demand segments, unit price and price movement, policies and other Govt. mandates that impact demand etc.

**IV. Supply Market Dynamics** - includes details regarding market size, overall industry capacity, key **Suppliers**, market growth and trends, mergers and acquisitions, etc. It covers Porter's five forces analysis (buyer power, supplier power, threat to new entrants, substitutes, and industry rivalry).

**V. Cost Structure** - includes details regarding Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) (including but not limited to unit cost, logistics, maintenance, warranty, insurance, wear and tear, administrative, taxes and overheads). TCO provides visibility on cost heads, helping estimate potential areas of cost improvement which can generate savings and spend optimization opportunities.

## 2.4 Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM)

### 2.4.1 Overview
a) The Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) process group consists of procedures to create, manage, and close contracts.

b) This section explains the activities, decisions involved, documents used, outcomes, and the stakeholders involved in the CLM processes.

c) The following Level 3 processes are included in the CLM process group:

1. Create and Publish Contract
2. Manage Contract Amendments
3. Manage Contract Claims/Penalties/Disputes
4. Close/Terminate Contract

d) Contracts may be stand-alone or organized into hierarchies where a master agreement (also known as framework agreement) is the parent to one or more sub-agreements (also known as call-off contract). Below is an illustrative example of contract hierarchy:

**Figure 2.4.1: Master Agreement – Sub-agreement Hierarchy**

e) Stand-alone agreement is the most commonly used contract type, entered between an Entity and **Supplier** for specific requirements. The Stand-alone agreement is not part of contract hierarchy.

f) A **Contracting Specialist/Lead** is assigned to execute CLM processes. For a contract against an Entity-Specific Category, the **Contracting Specialist/Lead** is assigned from the Entity managing the category. For a contract created against a Common Category, the **Contracting Specialist/Lead** is assigned from the GPO.

g) **Contract Administrators** are **End-Users** assigned to execute the contract.

## 2.5 Supplier Performance and Relationship Management (SPRM)

### 2.5.1 Overview

a) Supplier Performance and Relationship Management (SPRM) process group consists of procedures to segment *Suppliers*, manage relationships with selected *Suppliers*, and manage performance of *Suppliers* against open contracts.

b) This section explains the activities, decisions involved, documents used, outcomes, and the stakeholders involved in the SPRM processes.

c) The following Level 3 processes are included in the SPRM process group:

   1. Segment Suppliers
   2. Set Relationships with Selected Suppliers
   3. Evaluate and Manage Supplier Performance

### 2.5.2 Details of the Level 3 Processes

#### 2.5.2.(I) Segment Suppliers

1. **Scope and Purpose**

   i. The purpose of this process is to classify *Suppliers* into following pre-defined segments:

      a. **Strategic Suppliers** – show potential of innovation and collaboration, have a proven track record, and are some of the highest spend *Suppliers*.

      b. **Critical Suppliers** – are critical to everyday operations and any failure by such *Suppliers* has a significant impact on the Entity's operations.

      c. **Operational Suppliers** – have contracted commitments that require operational tracking and delivery monitoring.

      d. **Transactional Suppliers** – have minimal contracted spend with the least impact.

   ii. Common Category *Suppliers* are considered as Strategic *Suppliers*.

   iii. Segment Suppliers process is executed periodically, preferably once a year.

   iv. While segmenting Suppliers, it is crucial to consider the contracted spend with each *Supplier* for the same period to maintain a fair comparison. Only *Suppliers* with contracted spend during the period of review may be considered for this process.

   v. An *SRM Specialist* is assigned to segment *Suppliers*. To segment *Suppliers* catering to Common Categories, *SRM Specialist* is assigned from the GPO and to segment *Suppliers* catering to Entity-Specific Categories, *SRM Specialist* is assigned from the Entity managing the category.

DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

3. Update Supplier Registration
4. Qualify/Disqualify Supplier
5. Identify "Preferred" Supplier
6. Deactivate/Reactivate Supplier

e) The *Supplier Registration Team*, at the Department of Government Support (DGS), is responsible for onboarding *Suppliers* and maintaining the Supplier Master Database.

f) The Supplier MDM process group is enabled through the "SAP Ariba Supplier Lifecycle and Performance (SLP) module"

## 2.8.1.(I) Supplier Classification

The onboarding process of a *Supplier* varies with the type of *Supplier*. *Suppliers* can be broadly classified into the following two categories:

1. <ins>Abu Dhabi Suppliers (AD-DED)</ins>
   This category includes *Suppliers* that operate in the Abu Dhabi & have a valid Abu Dhabi DED license.

2. <ins>Non-Abu Dhabi Suppliers (Non-AD-DED)</ins>
   This category includes *Suppliers* that do not have a valid Abu Dhabi DED license. Such *Suppliers* may further be classified into:

   i. Local Suppliers (UAE Mainland and Freezone)
   ii. Foreign Suppliers

## 2.8.2 Details of Level 3 Processes

## 2.8.2.(I) Initiate Supplier Request

1. ### Scope and Purpose
   i. The *Supplier* onboarding process starts with a valid "Registration Request".
   
   ii. The purpose of this process is to create, review, and approve the "Registration Request" and ensure that *Supplier* records are not duplicated in the Supplier Master Database.

70

DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

## 2. Procedures and Methodologies

i. Raise "Registration Request"

   a. "Registration Request" and registration requirements change based on the *Supplier* classification, as illustrated below:

<table>
<tr>
<td>Self - Request</td>
<td>Supplier Classification</td>
<td>Entity Raised Request</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Abu Dhabi Suppliers<br>(AD - DED)</td>
<td>Non-Abu Dhabi Suppliers<br>(Non- AD - DED)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Local Suppliers<br>(UAE Mainland + Free zone)</td>
<td>Foreign Suppliers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Suppliers that operate inside UAE;<br>*No Attestation required*</td>
<td>Suppliers that only operate outside UAE;<br>*Attestation required*</td>
</tr>
</table>

*Figure 2.8.1 Supplier Classification*

   b. *AD-DED Suppliers* raise a "Supplier Self-Registration Request" by opening the "SAP Ariba Supplier Self-Registration Request link" and completing and submitting the "Self-Registration Request form".

   c. *Non- AD-DED Suppliers* request an Entity to raise an "Entity Raised Supplier Request", on their behalf. In such cases, the Entity user logs into "SAP Ariba Supplier Entity-Request Page", completes and submits the "Entity Raised Request Form", and uploads the required documents.

   d. The Entity user should validate the information provided by the *Supplier* before submitting the request and confirm that the business requirements which are met by the *Non - AD-DED Supplier* cannot be met by an *AD-DED Supplier*.

   e. The Entity user, while completing the "Entity-Raised Request Form" must confirm the expected spend with the *Supplier*. In case of *Foreign Suppliers*, this expected spend decides the attestation requirements.

ii. Review and Approve "Registration Request"

   a. The *Supplier Registration Team Lead*, upon receiving on the "Registration Request", assigns the request to a *Supplier Data Management Specialist* for review and approval.

   b. The *Supplier Data Management Specialist* reviews the "Registration Request" for duplication and validity of the information provided.

DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

c. If the "Registration Request" is unique and provided information is accurate, the **Supplier Data Management Specialist** approves the request and assigns himself/herself as the "Supplier Manager" for the **Supplier**. The "Supplier Manager" acts as the single point of contact for the **Supplier** during the registration and qualification processes.

d. As soon as the "Registration Request" is approved, the **Supplier** receives an invitation to register with "SAP Ariba Network". This email includes the "SAP Ariba Registration Link".

e. In case of Entity raised request, the Entity users is notified about the request status (approval/denied).

f. Suitable communication channels are established to support **Suppliers** during the registration process. The **Supplier Registration Team** must only use these channels to communicate with the **Suppliers**. The channels set up are:

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<strong>SAP ARIBA</strong><br>
<strong>"Request Additional Info"</strong><br>
<strong>functionality</strong><br><br>
<em>Supplier Registration Team can communicate with the Supplier via "Request Additional info" functionality after Supplier has submitted the "Registration Questionnaires"</em>
</td>
<td>
<strong>Helpdesk</strong><br>
<strong>Email</strong><br><br><br>
<em>Supplier Registration team may also communicate with the Supplier using the helpdesk email:</em><br>
<strong>srs@dgs.gov.ae</strong>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Figure 2.8.2 Communication Channels**

The "Request Additional Info" functionality is only active in "SAP Ariba" after the **Supplier** has completed and submitted "Registration Questionnaires". Hence it is not available during the Initiate Supplier Request process.
