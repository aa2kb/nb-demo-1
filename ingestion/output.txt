==================================================

Answer:
 Based on the provided HR Bylaws document, there is no explicit mention of a transition from full-time to part-time employment or vice versa. However, modifications of an employee's status are discussed in Article (55) of the bylaws. This article outlines conditions for an employee who obtains a higher qualification during their service in the Government Authority, including the extent to which the educational qualification matches their work and the needs of the Government Authority, as well as the prior approval of the Government Authority if the employee desires to obtain a higher qualification after joining the job.

It's important to note that this article pertains to changes in an employee's educational qualifications, not their employment status. If there are any policies or procedures for transitioning between full-time and part-time work within the organization, they may be found elsewhere in the HR bylaws or other related documents. It is recommended to consult those resources directly for more specific information.
