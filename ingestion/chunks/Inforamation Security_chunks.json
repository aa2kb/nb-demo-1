Our  dependence  on  these  technologies  will continue to grow in the future, and therefore, the UAE Government is committed to the development of a secure national information and communications infrastructure for UAE organizations and individuals to realize the full potential of its benefits, in the face of an evolving set of related cyber threats.\n\nAs  cyber  threats  such  as  hacktivism  and  cybercrime  evolve,  so  must  our  efforts  to defend against them in a coordinated and systematic manner. To align and direct national cybersecurity  efforts,  the  UAE  Government  created  the  National  Electronic  Security Authority  (NESA)  to  improve  our  national  cybersecurity,  and  protect  our  national information  and  communications  infrastructure.  As  part  of  this  mandate,  NESA developed the UAE Information Assurance (IA) Standards to provide requirements for raising the minimum level of IA across all relevant entities in the UAE.\n\nThe adoption of these Standards by UAE entities will sustain the benefits of a trusted digital environment for businesses and individuals across the nation. As cybersecurity is  the  shared  responsibility  of  every  organization  and  individual,  collaboration  and partnerships  between  the  Government  and  private  sector  organizations  are  key  to success.

Undoubtedly, IT and electronic communication have and will continue to play a pivotal role in the economic development of the UAE and the daily life of its citizens. Therefore, the UAE stands committed to the further development of its national IT and electronic communication infrastructure, as well as its cyberspace, to support economic development  and  provide  an  environment  where  the  interests  of  its  governments, businesses, and citizens can thrive.\n\nThe benefits of this technology adoption, however, come with a rapidly evolving set of cyber threats. These threats stem from a wide range of sources - including hacktivists, issue-motivated groups, and organized cybercrime syndicates - and represent national security concerns that can potentially disrupt critical national services and compromise critical information assets.\n\nMitigating cyber threats, and ensuring the development of a secure national information and communications infrastructure, and cyberspace, is a strategic priority for the UAE. To this end, NESA developed the UAE IA Standards as a critical element of the National Information  Assurance  Framework  (NIAF)  to  provide  requirements  for  elevating  the level of IA across all implementing entities in the UAE.\n\n11\n\nThe  development  of  the  UAE  IA  Standards  is  based  on  regional  and  global  best practices including:\n\n- ISO/IEC\t27001:2005 'Information technology - Security techniques - Information security management systems - Requirements',\n- ISO/IEC\t 27002:2005",

The application of  the  IA  lifecycle  is  facilitated  best  when  integrated  in  the  planning  and  governance activities of an entity or sector.\n\n24\n\nHAPTER 03\n\nUAE IA STANDARDS\n\nIMPLEMENTATION\n\n26\n\n## 3.1 OVERVIEW\n\nThe purpose of this chapter is to explain key concepts related to the implementation of the UAE IA Standards such as the risk-based approach to information assurance and the applicability and prioritization of security controls.  This chapter also highlights key stakeholder roles and responsibilities for the effective adoption and progression of the UAE IA Standards, and it lists critical implementation success factors.\n\nThe  implementation  of  these  Standards  is  meant  to  complement  any  existing information assurance programs at implementing entities.  This Standard represents the sole point of reference for compliance against its requirements, as measured by the criteria associated with each of its security controls.\n\n## 3.2\n\n## RISK-BASED APPROACH\n\nIn today's world, the cyber threat landscape is evolving rapidly at a pace where entities are challenged to keep up with the number and variety of threats.  In the face of this growing threat  landscape,  entities  need  to  adopt  practical  measures  to  defend  their  critical information and information infrastructure against their most critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited by threats.  To this end, a risk-based approach provides",

In the face of this growing threat  landscape,  entities  need  to  adopt  practical  measures  to  defend  their  critical information and information infrastructure against their most critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited by threats.  To this end, a risk-based approach provides entities with a pragmatic mean to identify their most critical vulnerabilities that could expose them to risks, and develop corresponding appropriate treatments.\n\nAdopting  a  risk-based  approach  ensures  that  security  controls  are  instituted  in accordance with current risk assessments commensurate with the risk and magnitude of  the  impact  that  could  result  if  critical  information  assets  are  compromised.    The risk-based  approach  briefly  outlined  in  these  Standards  summarizes  a  systematic methodology for identifying, estimating, evaluating, and treating identified entity-level risks. It consists of eight key activities as illustrated in Figure 3.\n\n## FIGURE 3: THE RISK-BASED APPROACH PROCESS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPerforming a risk management is a key step towards the implementation of the UAE IA Standards as it helps entities identify, prioritize, and measure the effectiveness of the security controls that are needed to treat identified entity-specific risks.

Critical entities implementing these Standards shall also refer to the National Cyber Risk Management Framework  (NCRMF)  which  highlights  the  National  Risk  Management  approach  and process of Critical Information Infrastructure.\n\n## ACTIVITY 1: ESTABLISHING THE ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe risk assessment process should be initiated by establishing objectives, strategies, scope and parameters of the activities of the entity, or those parts of the entity where the risk management process is being applied. Further, criteria for assessing risks should be established in line with the entity's objectives, available resources, and the magnitude of  impact  that  could  result  from  the  compromise  of  confidentiality,  integrity  and/or availability of information assets. Topics such as authenticity and non-repudiation could also be considered based on the entity context.\n\n## ACTIVITY 2: RISK IDENTIFICATION\n\nThe entity should identify sources of risk, areas of impacts, events and their causes, and the potential consequences. The aim of this step is to generate a comprehensive list  of  risks  based on the identified information security requirements. Because a risk that is not identified at this stage will not be included in further analysis, comprehensive identification is critical.\n\n## ACTIVITY 3: RISK ESTIMATION\n\nRisk  estimation  involves  consideration  of  the  causes  and  sources  of  risk  in  the  form of  threats  and  vulnerabilities,  their  impacts  in  terms  of  consequences  of  a  loss  of confidentiality,  integrity  and/or  availability  of  information,  and  the  likelihood  that  the potential impacts will occur. The risk should also take into account the effectiveness and efficiency of existing controls in addressing the current level of risk.\n\n## ACTIVITY 4: RISK EVALUATION\n\nRisk  evaluation  involves  comparing  the  level  of  risk  found  during  the  risk  estimation activity with risk criteria established at the beginning of the process as",

The objective is to determine which risks are outside acceptable parameters and therefore require treatment.\n\n## ACTIVITY 5: RISK TREATMENT\n\nFor each of the risks identified in the risk assessment, a number of treatment options can  be  considered  and  applied  either  individually,  or  in  combination,  for  treating  the risk.  There  are  several  options  that  are  usually  considered  for  treating  risks;  these options include:\n\n- Risk  Reduction -  Reducing  the  risk  by  applying  security  controls.  The  selection of  security  controls  should  follow  a  risk-based  approach  by  apply  the  first  set  of security  controls  that  treat  the  highest  risks  identified  during  the  Risk  Evaluation (See 3.4 Prioritization of Controls).\n- Risk Retention - Accepting the risk based on the entity's risk accepting criteria.\n- Risk Avoidance - Avoiding the activity or condition causing the risk.\n- Risk Transfer - Transferring the risk to another party.\n\n## ACTIVITY 6: RISK ACCEPTANCE\n\nThe risk acceptance is the decision to accept residual risk by the management of the entity. The management based on the acceptance criteria should review and approve the treat plan and the residual risk.\n\n## ACTIVITY 7: RISK MONITORING AND REVIEW\n\nThe  results  of  the  risk  assessment  and  treatment  process  need  to  be  monitored and reviewed for ongoing risk management, and to ensure their continued suitability.

The monitoring and review of information security  risks  should  be  a  planned  part  of the risk management process, and involve regular checking or surveillance as well as improvements  when  significant  changes  occur.  The  entity's  monitoring  and  review processes should encompass all aspects of the risk management process, including the  risk  criteria,  the  identified  assets,  threats,  risks,  risk  treatment  options  and security controls.\n\n## ACTIVITY 8: RISK COMMUNICATION AND CONSULTATION\n\nCommunication  and  consultation  with  key  stakeholders  should  take  place  during  all stages  of  the  risk  management  process.  Therefore,  plans  for  communication  and consultation  should  be  developed  at  an  early  stage.  These  should  address  issues relating  to  the  risk  itself,  its  causes,  its  consequences  (if  known),  and  the  measures being taken to treat it.

While this common risk profile is widely applicable to implementing entities, NESA recognizes that entity risk profiles do differ based on their specific business and operational context.  Given these differences, not all security controls provided in these Standards might be applicable to all  entities.  Therefore, these Standards require that the identification of the security controls be based on an entity risk assessment resulting in applicable security controls for the treatment of identified risks.\n\nPrior to performing the risk assessment process, an entity should consider all security controls  to  be  applicable.  However,  an  individual  entity  may  exclude  some  security controls  on  the  basis  of  the  risk  assessment  outcomes,  provided  that  adequate justification is submitted to NESA.\n\nMoreover, certain security controls included in these Standards represent requirements for instituting foundational IA capabilities within an entity, and as such, are considered 'Always  Applicable'.  Given  their  foundational  role,  the  'Always  Applicable'  security controls shall be implemented by each relevant entity regardless of its risk assessment outcomes (refer to Annex 1 for a summary of 'Always Applicable' controls).\n\nIn\tsummary,\tthe\tconcept\tof\tApplicability\tidentifies\tthe\tsecurity\tcontrols\tthat are\tmandatory\tfor\timplementation\tbased\ton\tthe\tlist\tof\tapplicable\tcontrols",

The compliance monitoring scheme is outlined in the UAE NIAF Governance and is based on the following four elements:\n\n## CONTROLS\n\nAll security controls specified in the UAE IA Standards need to be considered by each entity, and any entity wishing to claim compliance with these Standards shall implement these controls based on the following requirements:\n\n- Controls  that  are  'Always  Applicable'  -  these  security  controls  are  essential  and shall  be  implemented  by  any  entity  wishing  to  claim  compliance  with  the  UAE  IA Standards.  Omission  of  any  of  these  controls  is  not  acceptable  and  constitutes non-conformity.\n- Controls  that  are  applicable  based  on  the  risk  assessment  -  the  entity  shall determine  which  of  the  security  controls  provided  in  the  UAE  IA  Standards  are applicable in its particular situation based on the results of the risk assessment.  Any exclusion of these controls needs to be justified and evidence needs to be provided such  that  the  associated  risks  have  been  accepted  by  accountable  persons  or authorizing entities.\n\nThe  overall  set  of  security  controls  that  are  'Always  Applicable'  and  those  security controls that have been determined as being applicable based on the risk assessment are 'mandatory' for the entity to implement, and will be the basis of the compliance monitoring scheme",

These sub-controls specify mandatory implementation requirements. Also, it is expected that each entity claiming compliance shall implement the selected security controls by complying with the sub-controls during the implementation process as described below.\n\nThe entity shall implement all of the sub-controls of the 'Always Applicable' security controls.  Omission of any of these sub-controls is not acceptable and constitutes nonconformity to the UAE IA Standards.\n\nThe entity can decide to not implement a sub-control of a security control identified by  the  risk  assessment,  if  this  action  is  appropriately  justified  (e.g.  following  the  risk assessment or due to decisions or circumstances in the entity), or to implement the sub-controls  in  a  different  way.    Any  deviation  from  the  sub-controls  needs  to  be justified and evidence needs to be provided such that the associated risks have been accepted by accountable persons or authorizing entities.\n\n## PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\nPerformance indicators are intended to provide entities implementing the UAE IA Standards with some basic guidelines to measure the quality and effectiveness of its compliance with the control sub-families and controls of this Standard.

The choice of a suitable risk management approach should be taken when drafting the Information Security  Risk  Management  Policy  (refer  to  M2.1.1),  and  the  implementation  guidance  there explains the considerations the entity should take into account when deciding on a suitable way of doing information security risk management.

INFORMATION :  Databases,  files,  contracts  and  agreements,  system  documentation, research information, user manuals, training material, operational or support procedures, etc.\n- B. SOFTWARE ASSETS: Application software, system software, development tools, and utilities\n- C.  PHYSICAL ASSETS: Computer equipment, communications equipment, removable media\n- D.  OTHER EQUIPMENT\n- E. SERVICES: Computing and communications services, general utilities, e.g. heating, lighting, power, and air-conditioning\n- F. PEOPLE , and their qualifications, skills, and experience\n- G.  INTANGIBLES , such as reputation and image of the entity\n\nThe identified assets are summarized in the Asset Inventory (refer to T1.2.1).\n\nIt might be useful to summarize assets in suitable groups (e.g. all PCs in a call center, processing the same type of information), but care should be taken to only group 'like with like' when doing so.   It is also helpful to take account of business processes, as they often can help to understand the information flow and how assets are working in the entity.\n\n## IDENTIFICATION OF THREATS\n\nThreats are not very dependent on the entity and its business; they are just out there trying to succeed.

When identifying threats, it can be helpful to use threat lists (e.g. those provided in this Standard, or in other standards, such as ISO/IEC 27005), and to look into incident reports (incidents are always related to threats that have been successful- and audit reports, and to keep an open mind to the latest development as new threats will continue to emerge. It is also important to not only look at threats from the outside, such as hackers or malware, but also consider inside threats.  A disgruntled employee with given access rights can often do more damage as outsiders.\n\n## IDENTIFICATION OF VULNERABILITIES\n\nThe identification of vulnerabilities should be based on an assessment of the existing controls. To do so,  it  is  recommended  to  conduct  a  gap  analysis,  which  checks  the  controls  in  place against  this  Standard.  The  results  of  the  gap  analysis  form  an  input  in  the  identification  of vulnerabilities as well as into the assessment of the risk likelihood (see also M2.2.2 below). Any control, which has been identified as missing, not completely in place, not fully documented or not complied with identifies at least one (if not more- vulnerabilities, which might be exploited by the identified threats.\n\nPLEASE\tNOTE:\tThe\tidentification\tof\tthreats\tand\tvulnerabilities\ttakes\tplace\tper\teach\tidentified\tasset, so\t this\t easily\t produces\t a\t lot\t of\t information.\t To\t keep\t the\t amount\t of\t information\t manageable,\t it\t is recommended\tto:\n\n- A.

AVAILABILITY This means the information asset is available, when needed\n\nTo make the results of this assessment comparable, scales should be used, which should have been defined in the Information Security Risk Management Policy (see M2.1.1 above).\n\nThe assessment of these consequences should be done together with the business users of the information assets, as these can give important input into the process because they are aware  of  the  security  requirements  for  their  assets.  This  can  be  done  by  interviews  and/or questionnaires, but it is important to ensure that the business users understand what is asked from them.\n\nAs a result, each asset should have identified consequences of losses of confidentiality, integrity and availability..\n\n## LIKELIHOOD\tOF\tTHREAT/VULNERABILITY\tCOMBINATIONS\n\nThe input into the assessment of the likelihood that a particular threat exploits a vulnerability is based on very similar considerations as the identification of threats and vulnerabilities (see M2.2.1 above).

Please note that the implementation of the awareness and training program might not be carried out by the entity and can, for example, be ensured contractually.\n\nThe first step in the program is the evaluation of the competencies required for the job function. The  Information  Security  Manager,  for  example,  should  have  a  good  understanding  of  the controls contained in this standard, and should know how to implement them and to maintain them effectively.\n\nThe entity should ensure that trainings take place as planned, and are not pushed off, e.g. due to work overload.  If such problems recur, it might be a sign for inadequate resourcing.  If trainings continue not to take place in the time frame planned, it is a non-conformity to sub-control 2mentioned above.\n\nThe awareness and training program should ensure that records of all trainings are generated. These  records  should  regularly  be  reviewed  to  ensure  that  all  personnel  have  received  the training that they require.\n\nWhatever training is conducted, it is important that the effectiveness of this training is assessed. An  easy  way  of  such  as  assessment  is  to  select  trainings  that  include  an  exam  at  the  end. Whenever this is not possible, interviews of feedback form should be used that provide enough information to be able to evaluate the effectiveness of the training.\n\n| M3.3                                | SECURITYTRAINING                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

The  access  rights  that  should  be removed or adapted include physical and logical access, keys, identification cards, information systems, subscriptions, and removal from any documentation that identifies them as a current member  of  the  entity.  If  a  departing  employee,  contractor  or  third  party  user  has  known passwords for accounts remaining active, these should be changed upon termination or change of employment, contract or agreement.\n\nAccess rights for information assets and information systems should be reduced or removed before the employment terminates or changes, depending on the evaluation of risk factors such as:\n\n- A. Whether the termination or change is initiated by the employee, contractor or third party user, or by management and the reason of termination\n- B. The current responsibilities of the employee, contractor or any other user\n- C.

Controls for off-premise locations, such as home-working, teleworking and temporary sites should be determined by a risk assessment and suitable controls applied as appropriate, e.g. lockable filing cabinets, clear desk policy, access controls for computers and secure communication with the office\n- D. It may be appropriate to avoid the risk by discouraging certain employees from working off-site and/or by restricting their use of portable IT equipment\n- E. When off-premises equipment is transferred among different individuals or external parties, a log should be maintained that defines the chain of custody for the equipment including at least names and entities of those who are responsible for the equipment\n\nRisks, e.g. of damage, theft or eavesdropping, may vary considerably between locations and should be taken into account in determining the most appropriate controls.\n\n| T2.3.6",

System tuning and  monitoring  should  be  applied  to  ensure  and,  where  necessary,  improve  the  availability and efficiency of systems. Detective controls should be put in place to indicate problems in due time. Projections of future capacity requirements should take account of new business and  system  requirements  and  current  and  projected  trends  in  the  entity's  information processing capabilities.\n\nParticular  attention  needs  to  be  paid  to  any  resources  with  long  procurement  lead  times  or high costs; therefore managers should monitor the utilization of key system resources. They should identify trends in usage, particularly in relation to business applications or management information system tools.\n\nManagers  should  use  this  information  to  identify  and  avoid  potential  bottlenecks  and dependence on key personnel that might present a threat to system security or services, and plan appropriate action.\n\nP4\n\n## T3.3.1\n\n## CONTROL\n\n## SUB-CONTROL\n\n## BASED ON RISK ASSESSMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| T3.3.2",

Such logging should be activated, with logs sent to centralized logging servers. Firewalls, proxies, and remote access systems (VPN, dial-up, etc.) should all be configured for verbose logging, storing all the information available for logging in the event a follow- up investigation is required. Furthermore, operating systems, especially those of servers, should be configured to create access control logs when a user attempts to access resources without the appropriate privileges. To evaluate whether such logging is in place, an entity should periodically scan through its logs and compare them with the asset inventory in order to ensure that each managed item actively connected to the network is periodically generating logs. Analytical programs such as SIM/SEM solutions for reviewing logs can provide value, but the capabilities employed to analyze audit logs are quite extensive, including, importantly, evenjust a cursory examination by a person. Actual correlation tools can make audit logs far more useful for subsequent manual inspection. Such tools can be quite helpful in identifying subtle attacks. However, these tools are neither a panacea nor a replacement for skilled information security personnel and system administrators.

A graduated set of controls can be applied in different logical network domains to further segregate the network security environments, e.g.  publicly  accessible  systems,  internal  networks,  and  critical  assets.  The  domains  should be defined based on a risk assessment and the different security requirements within each of the domains.\n\nSuch  a  network  perimeter  can  be  implemented  by  installing  a  secure  gateway  between  the two networks to be interconnected to control access and information flow between the two domains. This gateway should be configured to filter traffic between these domains and to block unauthorized access in accordance with the entity's access control policy. An example of this type of gateway is what is commonly referred to as a firewall. Another method of segregating separate logical domains is to restrict network access by using virtual private networks for user groups within the entity.\n\nNetworks  can  also  be  segregated  using  the  network  device  functionality,  e.g.  IP  switching. Separate domains can then be implemented by controlling the network data flows using the routing/switching capabilities, such as access control lists.\n\nThe criteria for segregation of networks",

In particular, special care is needed in the selection of controls for wireless networks due to the greater opportunities for undetected interception and insertion of network traffic.\n\nEntities should consider a number  of actions to limit unauthorized use of wireless communications outside its boundaries include, for example:\n\n- Reducing  the  power  of  wireless  transmissions  so  that  the  transmissions  are  less  likely to  emit  a  signal  that  can  be  used  by  adversaries  outside  of  the  physical  perimeters of organizations\n- Employing measures such as TEMPEST to control wireless emanations\n- Using  directional/beam  forming  antennas  that  reduce  the  likelihood  that  unintended receivers will be able to intercept signals\n\nPrior  to  taking  such  actions,  entities  can  conduct  periodic  wireless  surveys  to  understand the radio frequency profile of its information systems as well as other systems that may be operating in the area.\n\n## T5.5\n\nOBJECTIVE\n\nPERFORMANCE INDICATOR\n\nAUTOMATION GUIDANCE\n\nRELEVANT THREATS AND VULNERABILITIES\n\n## OPERATING SYSTEM ACCESS CONTROL\n\nTo prevent unauthorized access to operating",

To verify that users with high-privileged accounts do not  use  such  accounts  for  day-to-day  web  surfing  and  e-mail  reading, security personnel should periodically gather a list of running processes to determine whether any browsers or e-mail readers are running with high privileges.  Such  information  gathering  can  be  scripted,  with  short  shell scripts searching for a dozen or more different browsers, e-mail readers, and document editing programs running with high privileges on machines. Some legitimate system administration activity may require the execution of  such  programs  over  the  short  term,  but  long-term  or  frequent  use of  such  programs  with  administrative  privileges  could  indicate  that  an administrator is not adhering to this control.

Once MAC addresses are confirmed, switches should implement 802.1x and NAC to only allow authorized systems that are properly configured to connect to the network. Going further, effective entities configure free or commercial network scanning tools to perform network sweeps on a regular basis, sending a variety of different packet types to identify devices connected to the network. Before such scanning can take place, entities should verify that they have adequate bandwidth for such periodic scans by consulting load history and capacities for their networks.

This should also take into consideration that the entity may have different levels of ability to negotiate these terms with a vendor based on the type of cloud services being purchased (e.g. private vs. public).\n\nPart  of  the  entity's  responsibility  includes  understanding,  where  possible,  where  information  will be stored, processed, or transmitted to ensure that often sensitive information privacy laws and other legal restrictions (e.g. prohibiting transmission of certain types of information outside national borders) are respected.\n\nIn addition, the entity should ensure that the terms and conditions of service delivery agreements provide  ample  clarification  on  how  information  will  be  migrated  from  the  selected  cloud  service provider  to  another  provider  (or  back  to  the  entity)  at  the  termination  of  the  service  delivery agreement.  This is critical to ensuring that the entity is not 'held hostage' by the service provider.\n\n## T7\t\t\tINFORMATION\tSYSTEMS\tACQUISITION, DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE\n\n| T7                                  | INFORMATIONSYSTEMSACQUISITION,DEVELOPMENTAND MAINTENANCE                                                                                                                                               |",

Products should be evaluated against these criteria before acquisition.

The use of appropriate programs to recover from failures to ensure the correct processing of data\n- D. Protection against attacks using buffer overruns/overflows\n\nAn appropriate checklist should be prepared, activities documented, and the results should be kept secure. Examples of checks that can be incorporated include the following:\n\n- A. Session or batch controls, to reconcile data file balances after transaction updates\n- B. Balancing controls, to check opening balances against previous closing balances, namely\n3. 1Run-to-run controls\n4. 2File update totals\n5. 3Program-to-program controls\n- C. Validation of system-generated input data\n- D. Checks on the integrity, authenticity or any other security feature of data or software downloaded, or uploaded, between central and remote computers\n- E. Hash totals of records and files\n- F. Checks to ensure that application programs are run at the correct time\n- G.

Where  a  software  package  needs  to  be  modified  the  following  points  should be considered:\n\n- A. The risk of built-in controls and integrity processes being compromised\n- B. Whether the consent of the vendor should be obtained\n- C. The possibility of obtaining the required changes from the vendor as standard program updates\n- D. The impact if the entity becomes responsible for the future maintenance of the software as a result of changes\n\nIf changes are necessary the original software should be retained and the changes applied to a clearly identified  copy.  A  software  update  management  process  should  be  implemented  to  ensure  the most up-to-date approved patches and application updates are installed for all authorized software. All changes should be fully tested and documented, so that they can be reapplied if necessary to future  software  upgrades.  If  required,  the  modifications  should  be  tested  and  validated  by  an independent evaluation body.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| T7.6.4                                                                                                                                                                   | INFORMATION LEAKAGE PRIORITY P2 APPLICABILITY BASEDONRISK ASSESSMENT",

OPSEC  is  a  process  of  identifying critical information and subsequently analyzing friendly actions attendant to operations and other activities to:\n\n- A. Identify those actions that can be observed by potential adversaries\n- B. Determine indicators that adversaries might obtain that could be interpreted or pieced together to derive critical information in sufficient time to cause harm to entities\n- C. Implement  controls  or  countermeasures  to  eliminate  or  reduce  to  an  acceptable  level, exploitable vulnerabilities\n- D. Consider how aggregated information may compromise the confidentiality of users or uses of the supply chain\n\nOPSEC may require entities to withhold critical mission/business information from suppliers and may include the use of intermediaries to hide the end use, or users, of information systems, system components, or information system services.\n\nP4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| T7.8.5                                            | RELIABLEDELIVERY PRIORITY P4 APPLICABILITY BASEDONRISK ASSESSMENT                        |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| CONTROL                                           | The",

A  point  of  contact  should  assess  the  information  security  events  using  the  agreed information  security  event  and  incident  classification  scale  and  decide  whether  the  events should be classified as information security incidents.\n\nIn case where the entity has CSIRT, the assessment and decision can be forwarded to the CSIRT for confirmation or reassessment. Results of the assessment and decision should be recorded in detail for the purpose of future reference and verification.\n\nAn attack is classified as an incident if the attack is directed against information assets, has a  realistic  chance  of  success  and  threatens  the  confidentiality,  integrity  and  availability  of information resources and assets.\n\nAn indication of an incident can be one or more of the following:\n\n- If dormant or inactive accounts started accessing system resources, querying servers, or engaged in other activities\n- If modification of logs occurs and the systems administrator cannot determine explicitly the authorized individual who modified them\n- Presence of hacking tools\n- Notifications by partner or peer\n- Notification by the attacker\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| T8.2.4",

Some enterprises have also found commercial services using remotely managed scanning appliances to be effective. To help standardize the definitions of discovered vulnerabilities in multiple departments of an entity or evenacross entities, it is preferable to use vulnerability scanning tools that measure security flaws and map them to vulnerabilities and issues categorized using one or more of the following industry-recognized vulnerability, configuration, and platform classification schemes and languages: CVE, CCE, OVAL, CPE, CVSS, and/or XCCDF. Advanced vulnerability scanning tools can be configured with user credentials to log in to scanned systems and perform more comprehensivescansthancanbeachievedwithoutlogincredentials.The frequency of scanning activities, however, should increase as the diversity of an entity's systems increases to account for the varying patch cycles of each vendor. Also, event log collectors and incident management systems should be considered. These technologies provide log collection, normalization, correlation and analysis: they can be very helpful both to detect incidents in their early stages and to investigate incidents. |\n| RELEVANT THREATSAND VULNERABILITIES | • Leakage of reported weaknesses • Unsuitable reporting procedures",

The list of threats types are aggregated from benchmark risk registers and mapped to mitigating controls to assist implementing entities during their risk assessment process.\n\nOverall,  a  number  of  security  controls  are  needed  to  mitigate  specific  threat  types  given  the  complex nature of the threats. As such, threat types along with their corresponding mitigating controls are outlined in Table 9 below.\n\nTABLE 9: MAPPING OF THREATS TO CONTROLS\n\n| CATEGORY   | THREATTYPE                                                                                                  | CONTROLNUMBERSOF MITIGATINGCONTROLS",

As a recap, sector and national level controls are designed to overcome the silos created by a single-entity approach to IA, and hence create a stronger and more integrated approach for national information assurance. They serve as foundational elements for developing the sector and national views of IA by enabling the integration and analysis of information relating to security threats, risks and incidents, as well as the state of these Standards implementation and risk assessment outcomes.\n\nOverall, the UAE IA Standards provides a total of 15 sector and national level controls as outlined in Table 10 below.\n\n## TABLE 10: SECTOR AND NATIONAL LEVEL CONTROLS\n\n| CONTROL   | CONTROL",
