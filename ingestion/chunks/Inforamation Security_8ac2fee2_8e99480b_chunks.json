Undoubtedly, IT and electronic communication have and will continue to play a pivotal role in the economic development of the UAE and the daily life of its citizens. Therefore, the UAE stands committed to the further development of its national IT and electronic communication infrastructure, as well as its cyberspace, to support economic development  and  provide  an  environment  where  the  interests  of  its  governments, businesses, and citizens can thrive.",

This will  rank  the  risks  in  order  of  severity  and  will identify those that are acceptable (because they are below the general threshold of acceptance), and those risks that will require treatment.\n\nIf necessary, the entity can assign additional priorities to the risks, e.g. if a risk - despite of not being high- relates to a very vital business process.  Any such assignment is entirely up to the entity, any decisions made should be reasoned and documented.\n\nDecisions on risks should take account of the wider context of the risk and include consideration of  the  requirements  of  other  parties,  such  as  sector,  regional  or  national  initiatives.  In  some circumstances, the risk evaluation can lead to a decision to undertake further analysis.\n\n| M2.3                               | INFORMATIONSECURITYRISKASSESSMENT                                                                                                                                                         |",

To evaluate whether such logging is in place, an entity should periodically scan through its logs and compare them with the asset inventory in order to ensure that each managed item actively connected to the network is periodically generating logs. Analytical programs such as SIM/SEM solutions for reviewing logs can provide value, but the capabilities employed to analyze audit logs are quite extensive, including, importantly, evenjust a cursory examination by a person.

This gateway should be configured to filter traffic between these domains and to block unauthorized access in accordance with the entity's access control policy. An example of this type of gateway is what is commonly referred to as a firewall. Another method of segregating separate logical domains is to restrict network access by using virtual private networks for user groups within the entity.\n\nNetworks  can  also  be  segregated  using  the  network  device  functionality,  e.g.  IP  switching.
