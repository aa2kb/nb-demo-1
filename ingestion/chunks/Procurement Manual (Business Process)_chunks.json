Introduction\n\n## 1.1 Introduction to the Procurement Manual\n\n## 1.1.1 Purpose of the Procurement Manual\n\nThe  Procurement  Manual  provides  operational  procedures  to  the  Procurement  practitioners.  It reinforces the Procurement Standards, the Procurement Charter, and the Procurement Delegation of Authority (PDoA), giving a more detailed explanation of their application.\n\n## 1.1.2 Scope of the Procurement Manual\n\nThe Procurement Manual applies to all procurement activities conducted by the government Entities and  the  Government  Procurement  Office  (GPO).  The  Executive  Council  (EC),  or  a  relevant  body authorised by the EC, may exclude an Entity from the application of the Procurement Manual. The Procurement  Manual  covers  all  relevant  procurement  processes  and  serves  as  the  operational framework.\n\n## 1.1.2.(I) List of Exemptions\n\nThe Procurement Manual does not apply to:\n\n- a) Staff salaries and benefits\n- b) Direct employment contracts or the engagement of individual experts which cannot be subject to tender\n- c) General  and  administration  expenses  for  non-predefined  technical  specifications,  electricity, water, utilities, accommodation rentals provided to the employees and governed by the housing policies,  professional  and",

In  line  with  global  best practices, UNSPSC (United Nations Standard Products and Services Code) taxonomy is recommended to be adopted by GPO and Entity Procurement .    UNSPSC is a four-level taxonomy with each record represented with an eight-digit number and unique name, illustrated below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEntity Procurement is  responsible for procurement of the Entity-Specific Categories including sourcing, contracting, ordering, and managing Supplier performance. The Entity Procurement utilizes  the  shared services provided by the GPO.\n\nThe  GPO  engages  stakeholders  from  the  Entities  and  dedicated Finance , Legal or  other  resources  as needed  for  procuring  Common  Categories.  The  Entity Procurement engages End-Users and  dedicated Finance , Legal or other resources for procuring Entity-Specific Categories.\n\n## 1.2.1 Category Classification\n\nClassification  of  a  category  as  a  Common  Category  or  an  Entity-Specific  Category  depends  on  the category spend value and its commonality across Entities. A category that is procured by five or more Entities may be considered as a Common Category.\n\nFigure 1.2.2 Common vs. Entity Specific Categories\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure 1.2.3 UNSPSC Categorizations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe four primary levels of the UNSPSC are Segment, Family, Class,",

Comparable price baseline\n\nIf a certain goods/service has not been purchased previously, historic price baseline cannot be established. In such cases, the baseline price can be estimated using comparable goods/services/projects  (identical  or  similar  specifications)  where  the  price  is  known.  (e.g., estimating  the  baseline  price  for  a  car  rental  service  by  comparing  it  with  similar  services previously purchased by another Entity).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## iii. New price baseline\n\nIf  neither  a  historic  nor  a  comparable  baseline  can  be  established,  a  new  baseline  can  be developed based on the initial RFI or RFP/RFQ responses provided by the Suppliers . The baseline price  will  be  calculated  as  an  average  of  the  approved  initial  quotes.  Any  price  reductions received through follow-on RFP/ auction/negotiation is considered as benefits.\n\n## 2. Procurement Benefits\n\nAs illustrated in Table 1.4.1 , Procurement Benefits are classified into three buckets:\n\n## i. Cost Savings\n\nFollowing are the various Cost Savings scenarios:\n\n## a. Standard Method (last paid price -new price)\n\nThis  method  is  used  when  the  savings  result  from  the  difference  between  baseline  and negotiated price. For example, when Suppliers are changed or when similar goods/services/projects  are  bundled,  resulting  in  a  better  price  per  item.  Savings  in  this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (baseline price -negotiated price) * volume\n\n## b.

Free of charges Extra\n\nThese are the savings realized when contracts negotiated with Suppliers include 'extras' that have not been part of the goods/service offering of past purchases. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = Savings from free of charge 'extra' per unit * volume\n\n## c. Fluctuating market price with market Index\n\nThis method of calculation is used when the cost savings can be attributed to a changing market index that results in a better future price (with respect to the market price). This method  is  applicable  for  commodities  (crude  oil,  metals,  Agri-commodities,  etc.)  where prices are linked to indices and change frequently. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = Forecasted spend with historical index value -forecasted spend with new index value\n\n## d. Fluctuating market price without market Index\n\nThis  method of calculation is used when there are no market price references available. There may be no good benchmarks to indicate the savings w.r.t the market.

Re-engineered specification (substitution) / rationalization\n\nFor some goods/services/projects, the specification can be changed to reduce the price. New specifications  examples  may  include  (but  not  limited  to)  using  black  and  white  printers instead of coloured printers, using standard cars instead of high-end cars for rentals, and using  standard  event  designs  instead  of  specialized  events.  Savings  in  this  scenario  are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (Cost for original item/service -cost for substitute item/service) * volume\n\n## g. In-house vs. Outsourcing\n\nFor some categories, where services are provided in-house, outsourcing of services might be a viable option. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (In-house cost (i.e. labor cost + material cost + overhead cost) -purchase price) x volume\n\n## h. Lease vs. Buy\n\nFor some categories lease of goods might be a viable alternative to buying (or vice versa). To compare the savings between leasing and buying options for goods, the cost per one unit needs to be calculated and compared. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (Cost of purchasing per unit - leasing cost per unit) * volume\n\n## i.

Suppliers with 'Disqualified' status in the Supplier Master Da tabase, maintained by the DGS should not be invited for Sourcing Events.\n\n## ii. Monitor Sourcing Event\n\n- a. While  responding  to  the  Sourcing  Event, Suppliers may  seek  clarifications  or  ask  for additional information.\n- b. The assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead responds  to Suppliers' queries.  The  responses  are recommended to be made available to all participating Suppliers for transparency. However, while  sharing  the  responses  the Sourcing  Specialist/Lead must  ensure  that  identity  of competing Suppliers' is kept confidential.\n- c. If required, the assigned Sourcing Specialist/Lead may modify a Sourcing Event, provided modifications  are  compliant  with  the  Procurement  Standards.  No  new Supplier can  be invited while modifying a published event.\n\nImportant Note: In case a new Supplier is to be added, the published event is cancelled, and another event is published with the updated list of Suppliers. This event will be considered as a new Sourcing Event.\n\n- d. The  assigned Sourcing  Specialist/Lead may  extend  Sourcing  Event  timelines  under  the following scenarios:\n- e. Modifications/additions have been made to the published Sourcing Event, due to which Suppliers require additional time to respond to the event.\n- f.

' Registration  Request ' and  registration  requirements  change  based  on  the Supplier classification, as illustrated below:\n- b. AD-DED Suppliers raise  a 'Supplier Self -Registration Request' by opening the 'SAP Ariba Supplier SelfRegistration Request link' and completing and submitting the 'Self -Registration Request form'.\n- c. Non- AD-DED Suppliers request an Entity to raise an 'Entity Raised Supplier Request', on their behalf. In such cases, the Entity user logs into 'SAP Ariba Supplier Entity -Request Page', completes  and  submits  the  'Entity  Raised  Request  Form',  and  uploads  the  required documents.\n- d. The Entity user should validate the information provided by the Supplier before submitting the request and confirm that the business requirements which are met by the Non - AD-DED Supplier cannot be met by an AD-DED Supplier .\n- e. The  Entity  user , while  completing  the  'Entity -Raised  Request  Form'  must  confirm  the expected spend with the Supplier . In case of Foreign Suppliers , this expected spend decides the attestation requirements.\n\nFigure 2.8.1 Supplier Classification\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ii.
