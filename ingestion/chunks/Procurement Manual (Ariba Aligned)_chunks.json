They are covered in the manual as per the following structure:\n\n1. Overview of the Process Group\n2. Overview of the 'SAP Ariba module'\n3. Details of level 3 Processes\n- i. (B) Scope and Purpose\n- ii. (B) Process Flow and Key Tasks\n- iii. (S) Roles and Responsibilities\n- iv. (B) Process Summary\n4. Work Aids - Forms and Documents\n5. RACI Matrix\n6. References to 'SAP Ariba Procurement User Guide'\n\nSections marked with a (B) -prefix elaborate the business aspects of the procurement processes and sections marked with an (S) -prefix describe the 'SAP Ariba' aspects of the procurement processes.\n\nReferences  to  'SAP  Ariba  Procurement  User  Guide' section provides  reference  to  the  section detailing the respective system tasks and functionalities in the 'SAP Ariba User Guide'.\n\nProcurement process maps, lists of tables and figures, and glossary of terms  and definitions  are provided in the Appendix.",

The Procurement Operating Model provides mandate, empowerment, and responsibilities of the Government Procurement Office (GPO) and Entity Procurement .\n\nFigure 1.2.1 Procurement Capability Model\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Government Procurement Office (GPO) is established to fulfil the following objectives:\n\n- 1) Acting on behalf of the Entities to consolidate demand for achieving economies of scale. The GPO is authorized to manage and execute sourcing for Common Categories.\n- 2) Providing shared services such as Supplier Registration, Item Master Management, User Master Management, and Training.\n- 3) Maintaining the Procurement Framework ensuring a standardized and efficient way of working of the Procurement .\n- 4) Developing and operating the information technology platform for government procurement (eGate).\n- 5) Running market development initiatives and managing partnerships with the private sector in coordination with the relevant authorities.\n\nEntity Procurement is  responsible  for  procurement  of  the  Entity-Specific  Categories  including sourcing, contracting, ordering, and managing Supplier performance. The Entity Procurement utilizes the shared services provided by the GPO.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1.2.2 Category Taxonomy\n\nCategory taxonomy refers to a hierarchical assignment of goods/services. In line with global best practices, UNSPSC (United Nations Standard Products and Services Code) taxonomy is deployed in 'SAP Ariba'.  It is a  four-level  taxonomy  with  each  record  represented  with  an  eight-digit  number  and  unique  name, illustrated below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe GPO engages stakeholders from the Entities and dedicated Finance , Legal or other resources as needed  for  procuring  Common  Categories.

The  Entity Procurement engages End-Users and dedicated Finance , Legal or other resources for procuring Entity-Specific Categories.\n\n## 1.2.1 Category Classification\n\nClassification of a category as a Common Category or an Entity-Specific Category depends on the category spend value and its commonality across Entities. A category that is procured by five or more Entities may be considered as a Common Category.\n\nFigure 1.2.2 Common vs. Entity Specific Categories\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure 1.2.3 UNSPSC Categorizations in 'SAP Ariba modules'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe four primary levels of the UNSPSC are Segment, Family, Class, and Commodity. Each level is identified by two digits, that constitute together an overall eight-digit code.\n\nAll Abu Dhabi DED activities are mapped to Level 2 UNSPSC categories. Suppliers are registered in the Supplier Master Database, maintained by the Department of Government Support (DGS), at Level 2 UNSPSC categories, and line items are created in 'SAP Ariba' at Level 3 UNSPSC categories.\n\n## 1.3 Procurement Capability Model\n\nThe Procurement Capability Model comprises of four types of procurement capabilities: Strategic, Tactical, Operational, and Support as illustrated below:\n\nFigure 1.3.1 Procurement Capability Model\n\n| Strategic   | Procurement Strategy        | Procurement Strategy            | Demand and Category Management   | Demand and Category Management                   |\n|-------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Tactical",

(e.g., estimating  the  baseline  price  for  a  car  rental  service  by  comparing  it  with  similar  services previously purchased by another Entity).\n\n## 3) New price baseline\n\nIf  neither  a  historic  nor  a  comparable  baseline  can  be  established,  a  new  baseline  can  be developed based on the initial RFI or RFP/RFQ responses provided by the Suppliers . The baseline price  will  be  calculated  as  an  average  of  the  approved  initial  quotes.  Any  price  reductions received through follow-on RFP/ auction/negotiation is considered as benefits.\n\n## ii. Procurement Benefits\n\nAs illustrated in Table 1.4.1, Procurement Benefits are classified into three buckets:\n\n## 1) Cost Savings\n\nFollowing are the various Cost Savings scenarios:\n\n## a. Standard Method (last paid price - new price)\n\nThis  method  is  used  when  the  savings  result  from  the  difference  between  baseline  and negotiated price. For example, when Suppliers are changed or when similar goods/services are bundled, resulting in a better price per item. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (baseline price - negotiated price) * volume\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## b. Free of charges Extra\n\nThese are the savings realized when contracts negotiated with Suppliers include 'extras' that have not been part of the goods/services/projects offering of past purchases. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = Savings from free of charge 'extra' per unit * volume\n\n## c. Fluctuating market",

Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = Savings from free of charge 'extra' per unit * volume\n\n## c. Fluctuating market price with market Index\n\nThis method of calculation is used when the cost savings can be attributed to a changing market index that results in a better future price (with respect to the market price). This method  is  applicable  for  commodities  (crude  oil,  metals,  agri-commodities,  etc.)  where prices are linked to indices and change frequently. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\n## Savings = Forecasted spend with historical index value - forecasted spend with new index value\n\n## d. Fluctuating market price without market Index\n\nThis method of calculation is used when  there are no market price references available. There may be no good benchmarks to indicate the savings w.r.t the market. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (Initial offer - negotiated offer) * expected volume\n\n## e. Volume Rebate\n\nThis method of calculation is used when the Supplier offers rebates on volume or similar incentives, which have not been included in previous purchases. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (new rebate per unit - old rebate per unit) * volume\n\n## f. Re-engineered specification (substitution) / rationalization\n\nFor some goods/services/projects, the specification can be changed to reduce the price. New specifications  examples  may  include  (but  not  limited  to)  using  black  and  white  printers instead of coloured printers, using standard cars instead of high-end cars for rentals, and using  standard",

Savings  in  this  scenario  are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (Cost for original item/service - cost for substitute item/service) * volume\n\n- g. In-house vs. Outsourcing\n\nFor some categories, where services are provided in-house, outsourcing of services might be a viable option. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (In-house cost (i.e. labor cost + material cost + overhead cost) - purchase price) x volume\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## h. Lease vs. Buy\n\nFor some categories lease of goods might be a viable alternative to buying (or vice versa). To compare the savings between leasing and buying options for goods, the cost per one unit needs to be calculated and compared. Savings in this scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nSavings = (Cost of purchasing per unit - leasing cost per unit) * volume\n\n## i. Reduced Cost of Disposal\n\nAt the end of their lifetime, some goods (e.g., Laptop) may be recycled. These costs need to be considered to determine the actual price of a product.

Following are the examples of initiatives and outputs:\n\nTable 2.1.2 Examples - Procurement Initiatives and Outputs\n\n| Procurement Objective                                               | Initiatives                                                                                                                        | Output                                                                         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Execute Strategic Sourcing to meet requirements at competitive cost |  Conduct Strategic Sourcing for categories contributing to top 80% of the Entity Spend                                            |  Achieve xx% annual savings across Common Categories                          |\n| Enhance visibility and control on Entity spend                      |  Conclude demand gathering by Q3  Analyse tail spend (bottom 20%) to identify opportunities of increasing spend under compliance |  Decrease unplanned spend by xx%  Increase spend coverage under PR-PO by xx% |\n| Reduce cycle times for procurement processes                        |  Include draft contract agreements in 100% of tenders                                                                             |  Decrease cycle time of contract signing by x%",

(B) Scope and Purpose\n\nCategory Management is a strategic approach to procurement. It encourages management of the procurement spend in groups of similar or related goods/services/projects, leading to consolidation and optimization opportunities. The advantages of Category Management include (but not limited to):\n\n- 1) A deeper understanding of market, products, suppliers and the supply chain\n- 2) Increased savings\n- 3) Improvement in service levels, quality, availability and value for money\n- 4) Enhanced Supplier relationships (higher Supplier performance)\n- 5) Reduced supply chain risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBelow",

The 'Project Owner' makes the recommended modifications and re-submits the 'Category Strategy', in the 'Category Strategy' folder in 'Documents\" tab, for approval.\n\nIn case the modified 'Category Strategy' requires review by the 'Reviewers', the 'Project Owner' may re-trigger the 'Review' task. Otherwise, the 'Project Owner' can re-trigger the 'Approval' task for approval.\n\nThe  approved  'Category  Strategy'  is  shared  with  the  relevant Sourcing  Specialists/  Leads, Contracting Specialists/Leads , and SRM Specialists outside 'SAP Ariba'.\n\n## iii.

(e.g., RFQ within a 'Quick Sourcing Project'). Single-Stage evaluation may imply that only one of the evaluations is required.\n\n## 2) Two-Stage Evaluation\n\nIn  a  two-stage  evaluation,  commercial  and  technical  evaluations  are  conducted  in  separate 'Envelopes'. In such cases, the commercial evaluations are conducted only for Suppliers that have qualified the technical evaluations. (e.g., RFP/RFQ within 'Full Sourcing Project')\n\nImportant  Note:  In  case  of  eAuctions,  the  'Bid  Console'  functionality  of  'SAP  Ariba'  can automatically  indicate  the  lowest  bid  for  all  line  items.

In this case, the 'Project Owner' of the 'Sourcing Project' marks the assigned Contracting Specialist/Lead as the 'Project Owner' of the 'Contract Workspace'.\n\nDepending upon the number of winning Suppliers , multiple 'Contract Workspaces' may be created against a 'Sourcing Project'. In this case, each 'Contract Workspace' has the 'Main Contract Document' and 'Contract Line Item Details (CLID)' specific to the Supplier . Below is an illustration of the same:\n\n| Line Itemf   | Deacription        | Winning supplier   | Price   | Qty   |\n|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------|-------|\n|              |                    | Supplier A         | XX      | YY    |\n|              | Item Description 2 | Supplier B         | XX      | :     |\n|              | Item Dezcription 3 | Supplier B         | XX      |       |\n|              | Item Description 4 | Supplier A         | XX      |       |\n|              | Item",

From 'Sourcing Project' (during the creation of the Sourcing Event itself)\n\nThis method of creating a 'Contract Workspace' is preferred when the 'Project Owner' (or associated 'Contract Manager') of the 'Sourcing Project' believes that the review of the 'Main Contract Document' requires significant time and can be done alongside the 'Sourcing Project' execution. Please refer to section 2.3.3.(IV)ii.2) for details.\n\n## c.

'Main Contract Document'\n\nThe 'Main Contract Document' is the legal document that defines the basis of the contract, including both parties' roles, responsibilities, and  a detailed description of the work. The 'Main Contract Document' could be the master agreement, sub-agreement or stand-alone agreement. The 'Project Owner' may use the 'Main Contract Document' templates provided in  'SAP  Ariba  Contracting  Library'  or  other  approved  template  covering  the  required elements.\n\nImportant Note: The 'Main Contract Document' may include the provision for a Performance Bond for the Supplier.

Below are the key activities for any 'Approval' task:\n\n- a. Step 1 - The 'Project Owner' initiates an approval by providing a 'Due Date'.\n- b. Step  2 -  The  'Approver'  opens  the  'Contract  Folder',  and  downloads  and  reviews  all required documents.\n- c. Step 3 - The 'Approver' approves/denies the documents and provides comments/ attaches modified documents within the 'Approval' task.\n- d. Step  4 -  In  case  the  'Approver'  has  denied  the  documents  (with  recommended changes/justification), the 'Project Owner' makes necessary changes and saves an updated version of documents in the 'Contract Folder'.\n- e. Step 5 - If  the 'Project Owner' believes that the modified documents require review by 'Reviewers', the 'Project Owner' re-triggers specific 'Review' tasks.\n- f. Step 6 -  In  case  the  review  by  the  'Reviewers'  is  not  required, the  'Project Owner' retriggers the 'Approval' task.\n- g. Step 7 - If the 'Approver' approves the documents, the 'Contract Folder' moves to the next 'Approver' in the chain automatically, and Step 2 - Step 6 are repeated.\n- h. Step 8 -  Once all  approvals are completed, the status of the 'Approval' task changes to 'Completed', automatically.\n\nImportant Note: Each 'Review' tasks is specific to a 'Reviewer', whereas an 'Approval' task is a single task with a chain of 'Approver'' designated as per the PDoA.",

Obtaining signatures is an offline process. The 'Project Owner' uploads a scanned copy of the signed 'Main Contract Document' in the 'Contract Folder' and marks the task 'Complete'.\n\nOne  hard  copy  is  shared  with  the Supplier while  the  other  hard  copy  is  retained  by  the Procurement after the contract is 'Published' in 'SAP Ariba'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3) Create 'Supplier Performance Management (SPM) Project' (optional task)\n\nAs  illustrated  in Figure 2.4.1,  the  'CLM  module'  interacts  with  the  'Supplier  Performance Management module' to monitor supplier performance against the respective contract. The 'Project  Owner'  creates  a  'Supplier  Performance  Management  (SPM)  Project'  against  the 'Contract Workspace,' as explained in section 2.5.3.(III)ii.1).\n\n## 4) Publish contract\n\nThe  'Project  Owner'  can  publish  a  contract  through  the  'Overview'  tab  of  the  'Contract Workspace'. Upon completing this activity, the 'Project Owner' confirms that the status of the contract is 'Published'. Only a 'Published' contract can be used for the Requisition to Pay (R2P) processes.\n\n## iii. (S) Roles and Responsibilities\n\n| Role                    | Responsibilities",

(B) Scope and Purpose\n\nThe contract amendment allows to make modifications to the existing contract, which have been approved  and  agreed  with  the Supplier .  An  amendment  may  be  an  addition,  deletion,  or modification to the existing contract. The original contract remains in place,  along with changes made via the amendment.\n\nIn the 'Contract Workspace', the following types of contract amendments are feasible:\n\nFigure 2.4.11 Contract amendments in 'Contract Workspace.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  'Administrative'  amendments  do  not  have  associated  'Review'  and  'Approval'  tasks.  The 'Project Owner' can directly make 'Administrative' amendments and publish without any review or approvals. On the other hand, selecting 'Amendment', 'Renewal/Extension', or 'Termination' type of amendments  creates  pre-defined  'To  Do',  'Review',  and  'Approval'  tasks  in  the  'Contract Workspace', which are referred to as amendment tasks.\n\nImportant Note: The 'Project Owner' executes modification to the unit price, UOM, or the quantity of the 'CLID' through 'Amendment' type of amendment in 'SAP Ariba'.\n\nThe purpose of this process is to initiate various types of amendment to the contract, as required.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ii.

In either case, the Contract Administrator confirms the validity of the amendment before the 'Project Owner' initiates respective tasks in 'Contract Workspace'. The Contract Administrator reviews the  amendment with the Budget Owner to  ensure  the  necessary  budget  is  available  for  the proposed amendment. This validation of the amendment is managed outside 'SAP Ariba'.\n\nIf  the amendment is invalid, it is communicated to respective stakeholders, and any relevant query is resolved. In case the amendment is valid, and the budget availability is confirmed, the Contract  Administrator communicates  the  details  of  the  amendment  and  asks  the  'Project Owner' to initiate the amendment tasks.\n\n## 2) Initiate contract amendment\n\nThe  'Project  Owner'  initiates  an  amendment  through  the  'Overview'  tab  and  selects  the suitable amendment type.

(B) Scope and Purpose\n\nThe  purpose  of  this  process  is  to  close  or  terminate  the  contract,  as  required.  A  'Contract Workspace' may be closed in the following scenarios:\n\n- 1) All contractual obligations are met.\n- 2) The 'Expiration Date' has passed, and the contract is 'Expired'.\n- 3) The contract is being 'Terminated' (either for convenience or for default).\n\nThis process covers all three scenarios and associated activities.\n\n## ii. (B) Process Flow and Key Tasks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure 2.4.22 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Close Contract\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1) Monitor 'Contract Workspace' for closure/expiry\n\nThe 'Project Owner' in collaboration with Contract Administrator monitors the following for an open contract:\n\n- a. Supplier performance against the contract through 'SPM Project'\n- b. Status of contractual obligations to estimate the contract closure\n- c. Upcoming contract expiry\n\nIn case the 'Expiration Date' of the contract approaches (before all contractual obligations are met), the 'Project Owner' may extend the 'Expiration Date' to allow the Supplier to meet all contractual obligations, provided such an extension is requested by Contract Administrator and has been duly approved. If relevant provisions exist in the contract, the 'Project Owner' may renew the contract after obtaining required approvals.\n\nThe process for 'Extension/Renewal'",

If relevant provisions exist in the contract, the 'Project Owner' may renew the contract after obtaining required approvals.\n\nThe process for 'Extension/Renewal' amendment is explained in section 2.4.3.(IV).\n\nIn case the contract is not to be renewed or extended, either the 'Project Owner' closes the 'Contract Workspace', or the 'Contract Workspace' automatically expires as per the initially set 'Expiration Date' (irrespective of the incomplete contractual obligations).\n\n## 2) Complete 'Contract Closure Checklist'\n\nThe  'Contract  Closure  Checklist'  contains  a  comprehensive  list  of  activities  to  be  completed before  the  contract  is  expired  or  closed.

(B) Scope and Purpose\n\nSegment  Suppliers  process  is  executed  periodically,  preferably  once  a  year.  The  process  of segmenting Suppliers into  pre-defined  groups  (Strategic,  Critical,  Transactional,  and  Operational) enables the procurement to optimize and prioritize its efforts and focus on developing long-term relationships with the right Suppliers.\n\nImportant Note: While segmenting Suppliers, it is crucial to consider the contracted spend with each  Supplier  for  the  same  period  to  maintain  a  fair  comparison.  Suppliers  that  do  not  have contracted spend for the period of review may not be considered for Segment Suppliers process.\n\nThe purpose of this process is to conduct the 'Supplier Segmentation Input Collection Survey' and prepare the 'Supplier Segmentation Report' in the 'Knowledge Projects (Supplier Segmentation)'.\n\n## ii.

(B) Process Flow and Key Tasks\n\nFigure 2.5.13 Process Flow and Key Tasks - Manage Supplier Performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1) Monitor progress against the 'SPM Plan.'\n\nThe progress against the approved 'SPM Plan' is monitored regularly to ensure better Supplier performance in the  next  evaluation cycle.  This monitoring  is  managed  entirely  outside  'SAP Ariba' and follows the below steps:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- a. Step 1 - The 'Project Owner' fills in the 'Progress Report' tab of the 'SPM Plan' (downloaded in the previous process) with approved high priority corrective actions.\n- b. Step 2 - The 'Project Owner' sends this 'Progress Report' tab to individuals executing the 'SPM Plan' to track the progress made against each corrective action.\n- c. Step 3 -  The  'Project Owner' monitors the progress made against each corrective action through multiple rounds of inputs, if required.\n\n## 2) Close the 'SPM Plan'\n\nThe 'Project Owner' may close the 'SPM Plan' by uploading the updated 'Progress Report' tab in the 'Documents' tab and marking the 'Monitor and Close Plan' task 'Complete'.\n\n## 3) Close the 'SPM Project'\n\nThe 'Project Owner' marks the 'SPM Project' 'Completed', through the 'Overview' tab, after the associated 'Contract Workspace' is 'Closed' or 'Expired'.\n\n## iii.

Same/Different  Suppliers -  Goods/services/projects  requested  in  the  PR  are  procured through one or multiple Suppliers.\n- b. Same/Different Ship to Address -  Goods/services/projects requested in the PR are to be delivered across one or more locations.\n- c. Catalogue vs. Non-Catalogue - Goods/services/projects requested in the PR may be partially fulfilled through an existing contract.\n\n## Important Note: An approved PR is not to be split into multiple POs to bypass approval authorities.\n\nA PR may be converted into a PO directly, through an existing contract, or through sourcing and contracting processes. PO is created by the Procurement .\n\nImportant Note: Approved PR is verified by the Procurement against existing contracts to identify if the requirement can be fulfilled without entering into new obligations.\n\nA Purchase Order (PO) includes details defining what the Supplier needs to fulfil the order. The PO serves as an electronic trace defining the purchase. The details relevant for the PO include (but not limited to):\n\n- a. Supplier details\n- b.

Delivery Rejection\n\nDelivery of goods may be rejected if the quantity or the specifications do not match with that provided in the PO. In such cases, the discrepancy is communicated to the Procurement and the Supplier. Depending  on  the  reason  for  rejection,  the Supplier either  replaces  the defective/damaged goods or delivers the missing goods.\n\nIn case of services/projects, the Supplier is communicated of the deficiency of service against the PO (mapped against milestones, variance from the KPI's/SLA, timelines etc.).\n\nDelivery of goods/services/projects can be rejected completely or partially (e.g., % of goods delivered  are  not  as  per  the  specification  in  the  PO).  In  case  of  partial  rejection,  partial Goods/Services/Projects Receipt is created against the PO.\n\nIf required, the Procurement may also fulfil the pending requirement through an alternate Supplier .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## b.

Suppliers can  be  broadly classified into the following two categories:\n\n## i. Abu Dhabi Suppliers (AD-DED)\n\nThis category includes Suppliers that operate in the Abu Dhabi &amp; have a valid Abu Dhabi DED license.\n\n## ii. Non-Abu Dhabi Suppliers (Non-AD-DED)\n\nThis category includes Suppliers that do not have a valid Abu Dhabi DED license. Such Suppliers may further be classified into:\n\n- 1) Local Suppliers (UAE Mainland and Freezone)\n- 2) Foreign Suppliers\n\nThe Supplier Registration Team , at the Department of Government Support (DGS), is responsible for onboarding Suppliers and maintaining the Supplier Master Database.\n\n## 2.8.2 'SAP Ariba Module' Overview\n\nThe  Supplier  MDM  process  group  is  enabled  through  the  'SAP  Ariba  Supplier  Lifecycle  and Performance (SLP) module'.

Registration of a Supplier in the Supplier Master Database is necessary for the Supplier to participate in Limited Tenders.\n\nThe Supplier Qualification enables Suppliers to complete and submit the 'Qualification Questionnaire' to be reviewed by the Supplier Registration Team . Qualification of a Supplier in the Supplier Master Database is necessary for the Supplier to  conduct business activities, including (but not limited to) receiving award, PO and submitting invoices.\n\nThe Supplier Qualification also includes process to disqualify a Supplier , if required. Suppliers can be blacklisted through the disqualification process.\n\nThe Supplier Deactivation/Reactivation enables the Supplier Registration Team to deactivate/reactivate the Suppliers , as required.

In such cases, the Entity user logs into 'SAP Ariba Supplier Entity-Request Page', completes  and  submits  the  'Entity  Raised  Request  Form',  and  uploads  the  required documents.\n\nThe Entity user should validate the information provided by the Supplier before submitting the request and confirm that the business requirements which are met by the Non - AD-DED Supplier cannot be met by a Supplier that holds an Abu Dhabi DED license.\n\nThe  Entity  user , while  completing  the  'Entity-Raised  Request  Form'  must  confirm  the expected spend with the Supplier .

Duplicate  'Registration  Request'  'SAP  Ariba'  automatically  highlights  if  the  received 'Registration Request' is a duplicate and highlights potential matches using the following fields:\n2. a1. 'Company Name'\n3. a2. 'Commercial/Industrial License Number'\n4. a3. 'Tax Registration Number'\n\nIn case 'SAP Ariba' highlights potential matches for a 'Registration Request', the Supplier Data Management Specialist checks for the following points, across potential duplicates:\n\n- b. Suppliers with the same 'Company Name' appear as potential matches in 'SAP Ariba' . In this case, the Supplier Data Management Specialist should compare the 'Commercial/Industrial License  Number'  and  'Tax  Registration  Number'  with  that  of  the  potential  matches  to determine if the 'Registration Request' is a duplicate.\n- c. Suppliers related to each other (e.g., parent and child companies) may have the same 'Tax Registration Number'. Such Suppliers appear as potential matches in 'SAP Ariba'. In such cases, the Supplier Data Management Specialist should compare the 'Commercial/Industrial License Number' with that of the potential matches to determine if the 'Registration Request' is a duplicate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nImportant Note: Different 'Commercial/Industrial License",

The responsibility for maintaining Item Master Data is centralized with changes to the records initiated by the Entities.\n\nFollowing  guidelines  must  be  adhered  to  during  creation  and  maintenance  of  the  Item  Master Database:\n\n- 1) Records of Item Master Data are created for frequently purchased goods/services.\n- 2) Each item is identified by a unique code in the Item Master Data.\n- 3) The record of each item contains (but not limited to):\n- a. Item Code\n- b. Description\n- c. Item type\n- d. Item group\n- e. Unit of Measurement\n- f. Unit price.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4) Each item belongs to one of the UNSPSC Level 3 'Classes'.

The raised request must be approved by the supervisor of the requestor. The Helpdesk forwards the request to the Item Master Data team.\n\nThe Item Master Data team reviews the raised request for completeness, accuracy, and duplication.\n\nIn case the request is duplicate, the Item Master Data team rejects the request and communicate the same to the GPO helpdesk. The GPO helpdesk communicates the same to the Entity requestor.\n\nIn  case  the  request  if  inaccurate  or  incomplete,  the  Item  Master  Data  team  seeks  additional information from the Entity requestor (through Helpdesk).\n\nIf  case  the  request  is  accurate,  complete,  and  valid,  the  Item  Master  Data  team  obtains  required approvals as per the PDoA to create/modify/delete the record, depending upon the request. Once approved,  the  Item  Master  Data  completes  executes  the  request  in  the  Item  master  Data  and communicates the same to the GPO Helpdesk.
