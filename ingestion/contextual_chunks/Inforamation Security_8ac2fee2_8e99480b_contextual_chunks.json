This will  rank  the  risks  in  order  of  severity  and  will identify those that are acceptable (because they are below the general threshold of acceptance), and those risks that will require treatment.\n\nIf necessary, the entity can assign additional priorities to the risks, e.g. if a risk - despite of not being high- relates to a very vital business process.  Any such assignment is entirely up to the entity, any decisions made should be reasoned and documented.\n\nDecisions on risks should take account of the wider context of the risk and include consideration of  the  requirements  of  other  parties,  such  as  sector,  regional  or  national  initiatives.  In  some circumstances, the risk evaluation can lead to a decision to undertake further analysis.\n\n| M2.3                               | INFORMATIONSECURITYRISKASSESSMENT                                                                                                                                                         |",
