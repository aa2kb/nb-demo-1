The objective is to determine which risks are outside acceptable parameters and therefore require treatment.\n\n## ACTIVITY 5: RISK TREATMENT\n\nFor each of the risks identified in the risk assessment, a number of treatment options can  be  considered  and  applied  either  individually,  or  in  combination,  for  treating  the risk.  There  are  several  options  that  are  usually  considered  for  treating  risks;  these options include:\n\n- Risk  Reduction -  Reducing  the  risk  by  applying  security  controls.  The  selection of  security  controls  should  follow  a  risk-based  approach  by  apply  the  first  set  of security  controls  that  treat  the  highest  risks  identified  during  the  Risk  Evaluation (See 3.4 Prioritization of Controls).\n- Risk Retention -",
