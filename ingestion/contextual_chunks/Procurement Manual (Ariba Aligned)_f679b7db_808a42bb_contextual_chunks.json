Such scenarios may include (but not limited to):\n\n- 1) 'Sourcing Request' is no longer valid (requested goods/services/projects are not required anymore).\n- 2) Suppliers shortlisted for the Sourcing Event did not respond to the event.\n- 3) Suppliers responses to a Sourcing Event are invalid and cannot be evaluated.\n- 4) No agreement reached post-negotiations, and original bids are not acceptable.\n\nThe purpose of this process is to cancel the Sourcing Event/'Sourcing Project'/'Sourcing Request' in 'SAP Ariba', as required and inform the participating Suppliers .\n\n## ii.
